Production-Ready Specification (`food_water_source_types_master`) This document 
details the structure, purpose, and considerations for the 
`food_water_source_types_master` table, Version 1.2.1 (reflecting RLS role name 
alignment). This version incorporates full V2 audit columns, an `is_active` 
flag for lifecycle management, and refined indexing and translation handling. 
1\. Purpose & Primary Use-Cases The `food_water_source_types_master` table 
defines the specific types of food establishments or water sources available 
(e.g., "Public Fountain - Potable," "Restaurant," "Grocery Store"). Its purpose 
is to provide a standardized, translatable classification that drives UI 
elements (like map icons, filter options), helps users distinguish between 
commercial services and free resources, and ensures data consistency. Key uses 
include pilgrim POI identification and filtering, admin content categorization 
for food/water waypoints, and system UI display of icons and filter controls. 
2\. Schema | column | data_type | constraints | description | | `id` | 
`INTEGER` | Primary Key (Generated as identity always) | Unique identifier for 
the food/water source type. | | `code` | `TEXT` | Unique, Not Null, CHECK 
(length(`code`) > 0 AND length(`code`) &lt;= 50 AND `code` ~ '^[a-z0-9_]+$') |

'restaurant'). Snake_case. | | `label` | `TEXT` | Not Null, CHECK 
(length(`label`) > 0 AND length(`label`) &lt;= 100) | Human-readable label for 
UI display. Primary reference language (English) text. (Translatable via 
`public.translations`). | | `description` | `TEXT` | Nullable | Optional 
description of the source type, providing more context. Primary reference

`icon_identifier` | `TEXT` | Nullable, CHECK (`icon_identifier` IS NULL OR 
length(`icon_identifier`) &lt;= 100) | Name, class, or path for a UI icon 
associated with this source type. | | `is_commercial` | `BOOLEAN` | Not Null, 
Default `false` | Flag to distinguish commercial establishments (e.g., 
restaurant, shop) from non-commercial ones (e.g., public fountain, natural 
spring). | | `sort_order` | `INTEGER` | Not Null, Default `0` | Determines the 
display order in UI lists or filters. Lower numbers appear first. | |

`id` (`INTEGER`). - Unique Constraint: `code` must be unique and follow the 
defined pattern. - Foreign Key References FROM other tables: 
`food_water_sources_details.source_type_id` references 
`food_water_source_types_master.id` (ON DELETE RESTRICT). The 
`food_water_sources_details` table includes a trigger to ensure the referenced 
`food_water_source_types_master` record has `is_active = true`. - Foreign Key 
References TO other tables: - `created_by_profile_id` REFERENCES 
`public.profiles(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL. - `updated_by_profile_id` REFERENCES 
`public.profiles(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL. 6\. Multilingual Strategy - 
Translatable Fields: `label` and `description`. These columns store their 
content in the primary reference language (English). They are designated as 
translatable via the central `public.translations` table, where translations 
into other languages are stored. - Non-Translatable Fields: `code` is a stable 
system identifier. `is_commercial`, `sort_order`, and `is_active` are 
structural/flag fields and are not translatable text. `icon_identifier` is a 
system value. - Orphan Cleanup: An `AFTER DELETE` trigger 
(`trigger_cleanup_food_water_source_type_translations`) is implemented. It 
calls `public.cleanup_food_water_source_type_translations` (which internally 
would use a generic like `public.cleanup_related_translations`) to remove any 
orphaned entries from `public.translations` when a 
`food_water_source_types_master` record is deleted. 7\. Role-Based Workflow & 
RLS Notes - Content Management: This master table is typically managed by 
`platform_admin` users who define and maintain the canonical list of food and 
water source types for the entire platform. - Lifecycle: Types are made 
inactive or "retired" by setting their `is_active` flag to `false`. Physical 
deletion of a record is restricted by the Foreign Key constraint from the 
`food_water_sources_details` table if any food/water source detail entry is 
actively using that type. The "active check" trigger on 
`food_water_sources_details` also prevents linking to inactive types. - RLS 
Policies: - Row-Level Security is enabled. - Public Users (`SELECT`): Can read 
all `food_water_source_types_master` records where `is_active = true`. - 
Authenticated Users (`platform_admin` role via `public.has_role_on_profile` 
helper): Have `ALL` permissions (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) to manage 
these types. 8\. ENUM vs Lookup Discussion - Decision: This 
`food_water_source_types_master` table is a V2-compliant lookup table, 
correctly promoting an original `food_water_source_type_enum` concept. - 
Reasoning: Using a lookup table is essential for this classification due to its 
direct impact on user safety (e.g., distinguishing potable water sources) and 
logistical planning (e.g., identifying commercial vs. non-commercial sources). 
This approach allows for richer attributes such as translatable `label` and 
`description` fields, a dedicated `icon_identifier` for UI consistency, the 
critical `is_commercial` boolean flag (which can drive UI logic in dependent 
tables), an `is_active` flag for proper lifecycle management, `sort_order` for 
controlled presentation, and standard audit columns for traceability. This 
offers significantly more flexibility, maintainability, and data integrity than 
a hardcoded ENUM. 9\. UI/UX Enablement - `label` (translated): Used for clear 
and understandable display names in filters, map legends, and within the detail 
views of individual food/water sources. - `icon_identifier`: Drives the display 
of distinct map icons and list icons, helping users quickly identify the nature 
of a food or water source (e.g., a fountain icon, a restaurant icon, a grocery 
store icon). - `is_commercial`: This flag is crucial for the UI. It can be used 
to visually differentiate commercial points from public/free resources (e.g., 
different color map pins, or by determining whether to display price range 
information from the `food_water_sources_details` table). - `sort_order`: 
Ensures a logical and consistent presentation order of these source types in UI 
filter dropdowns, selection lists, or legends. - `is_active`: The UI should 
primarily present and allow filtering or selection based on active source types 
for general users and when content managers are creating new food/water source 
entries. 10\. Key Considerations & Definitions - Clarity and Distinction: The 
`code` and `label` for each type must be intuitive and clearly distinct to 
avoid any ambiguity for data managers entering information and for pilgrims 
interpreting it on the frontend. The distinction between various types of 
potable and non-potable water sources, as well as different kinds of food 
establishments, is particularly important. - Icon Set: A comprehensive and 
easily understandable set of icons corresponding to each `icon_identifier` 
needs to be available and consistently applied in the frontend application to 
ensure effective visual communication. - `is_commercial` Flag Impact: This 
boolean flag is a key differentiator. UI logic for displaying details from the 
`food_water_sources_details` table should adapt based on this flag; for 
example, fields related to pricing or payment methods are generally only 
relevant if `is_commercial = true`. - Seed Data Comprehensiveness: The initial 
seed data provided for this table must be reviewed to ensure it covers all 
expected types of food and water sources relevant to the pilgrimage routes and 
user needs from the outset. 11\. Scalability & Future-Proofing - Lookup Table 
Structure: The design is highly scalable. New source types can be easily added, 
or attributes of existing ones (like icons or descriptions) modified, without 
requiring schema changes to the `food_water_sources_details` table or other 
parts of the system that might reference these types. - Manageable Number of 
Types: The total number of distinct food and water source types is expected to 
be manageable, ensuring that the table remains performant for queries and easy 
to administer. - Audit and Lifecycle Management: The inclusion of full audit 
columns and the `is_active` flag provides a robust framework for tracking 
changes and managing the lifecycle of these source types, allowing types to be 
retired gracefully without losing historical data context. 12\. Next-Action 
Checklist - 🔴 Verify Prerequisite Tables: Confirm `public.profiles` and 
`public.translations` tables are V2 compliant and exist. - 🔴 Implement 
`food_water_source_types_master` Table: Execute the DDL for Version 1.2.1 as 
specified, ensuring role names in RLS policies are correct. - 🔴 Apply 
Triggers: Ensure the `set_current_timestamp_updated_at` trigger and the 
`trigger_cleanup_food_water_source_type_translations` are created and correctly 
applied. - 🔴 Initial Population / Seed Data: Insert the initial set of 
food/water source types using the seed data examples provided in the original 
`4.8 food_water_source_types_master.docx` (adjusting for `label` and 
`description` columns), and ensure `is_active` is set to `true` and 
`created_by_profile_id` is populated for these initial records. - 🟠 RLS Helper 
Functions: Ensure that helper functions like 
`public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'role_name')` are defined, secure, and 
used consistently in RLS policies. - 🟠 RLS Policies: Implement and thoroughly 
test the RLS policies defined for this table. - 🟢 Iconography Coordination: 
Ensure the `icon_identifier` list used in seed data is coordinated with the 
UI/UX team for the preparation of corresponding visual assets. - 🟢 Translation 
Entries: Prepare initial English entries for all translatable fields (`label`, 
`description`) in the `public.translations` table, ensuring they are correctly 
linked.
