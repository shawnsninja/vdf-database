Production-Ready Specification (`water_reliability_types_master`) This document 
details the structure, purpose, and considerations for the 
`water_reliability_types_master` table, Version 1.2.1 (reflecting RLS role name 
alignment). This version incorporates full V2 audit columns, an `is_active` 
flag for lifecycle management, and refined indexing and translation handling. 
1\. Purpose & Primary Use-Cases The `water_reliability_types_master` table 
defines the different levels of reliability for natural or public water sources 
(e.g., "Year-round Reliable," "Seasonal - Check Locally," "Can Be 
Dry/Unreliable"). Its primary purpose is to provide standardized, translatable, 
and descriptive terms so pilgrims can make informed decisions about water 
planning, which is critical for their safety and comfort on the journey. Key 
user-story touchpoints include pilgrims assessing water source trustworthiness, 
understanding seasonal variations, administrators accurately classifying water 
source reliability, and the UI displaying clear reliability indicators. 2\.

Primary Key: `id` (`INTEGER`). - Unique Constraint: `code` must be unique and 
follow the defined pattern. - Foreign Key References FROM other tables: 
`food_water_sources_details.water_reliability_id` references 
`water_reliability_types_master.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL). The 
`food_water_sources_details` table includes a trigger to ensure the referenced 
`water_reliability_types_master` record has `is_active = true`. - Foreign Key 
References TO other tables: - `created_by_profile_id` REFERENCES 
`public.profiles(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL. - `updated_by_profile_id` REFERENCES 
`public.profiles(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL. 6\. Multilingual Strategy - 
Translatable Fields: `label` and `description`. These columns store their 
content in the primary reference language (English). They are designated as 
translatable via the central `public.translations` table, where translations 
into other languages are stored. - Non-Translatable Fields: `code` is a stable 
system identifier and is not translated. `advisory_level`, `sort_order`, and 
`is_active` are structural/flag fields and not translatable text. 
`icon_identifier` is a system value. - Orphan Cleanup: An `AFTER DELETE` 
trigger (`trigger_cleanup_water_reliability_type_translations`) is implemented. 
It calls `public.cleanup_water_reliability_type_translations` to remove any 
orphaned entries from `public.translations` when a 
`water_reliability_types_master` record is deleted, ensuring data consistency. 
7\. Role-Based Workflow & RLS Notes - Content Management: This master table is 
typically managed by `platform_admin` users who define and maintain the 
canonical list of water reliability classifications for the entire platform. - 
Lifecycle: Reliability types are "retired" by setting their `is_active` flag to 
`false`. Physical deletion of a record will set the foreign key in 
`food_water_sources_details.water_reliability_id` to `NULL` if any food/water 
source detail entry is actively using that type. The "active check" trigger on 
`food_water_sources_details` also prevents linking to inactive types. - RLS 
Policies: - Row-Level Security is enabled. - Public Users (`SELECT`): Can read 
all `water_reliability_types_master` records where `is_active = true`. - 
Authenticated Users (`platform_admin` role via `public.has_role_on_profile` 
helper): Have `ALL` permissions (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) to manage 
these types. 8\. ENUM vs Lookup Discussion - Decision: This 
`water_reliability_types_master` table correctly promotes an original 
`water_reliability_enum` concept into a full V2-compliant lookup table. - 
Reasoning: This classification is critical for pilgrim safety. A lookup table 
allows for richer, translatable `label` and `description` fields (important for 
conveying nuances like "check locally"), association of distinct 
`icon_identifier` values, an `advisory_level` for programmatic UI styling 
(e.g., color-coding reliability), an `is_active` flag for lifecycle management, 
`sort_order` for consistent presentation, and standard audit columns. This 
provides significantly more flexibility and control than a hardcoded ENUM. 9\. 
UI/UX Enablement - `label` (translated): Used for clearly displaying the 
reliability status of a water source to users. - `description` (translated): 
Can be used for tooltips or expanded information sections in the UI to help 
pilgrims understand the implications and any necessary precautions for a given 
reliability status (e.g., advice to boil or filter water if status is "seasonal 
- check locally"). - `icon_identifier`: Drives the display of map icons or list 
icons to visually communicate water reliability at a glance (e.g., a green 
check for reliable, a yellow warning icon for seasonal, a red cross for not 
potable). - `advisory_level`: Allows the UI to programmatically apply styling, 
such as color-coding (e.g., green, yellow, red based on levels 0, 1, 2) or 
other visual cues to rank or emphasize reliability levels. - `sort_order`: 
Ensures that reliability types are presented in a logical and consistent order 
in UI elements like filter dropdowns or legends, typically from most reliable 
to least reliable. - `is_active`: The UI should primarily present and allow 
filtering/selection based on active reliability types. 10\. Key Considerations 
& Definitions - Actionable Advice: The `label` and `description` fields (and 
their translations) should aim to provide clear, unambiguous, and actionable 
advice to pilgrims regarding water safety and planning (e.g., "Boil or filter 
if 'check locally'"). - Iconography: Consistent and intuitive icons for each 
`icon_identifier` are key for quick visual assessment by pilgrims on maps or 
lists. The meaning of each icon should be clear and possibly explained in a 
legend. - `unknown_reliability` Type: The inclusion of a type like 
'unknown_reliability' in the seed data is important as a default or fallback if 
the reliability information for a specific water source is missing or has not 
yet been verified. This helps manage data completeness and user expectations. - 
Seed Data Accuracy: The initial seed data must accurately reflect the intended 
meaning and advisory level for each reliability code. These definitions 
directly impact pilgrim safety. 11\. Scalability & Future-Proofing - Manageable 
List: The number of distinct water reliability types will be small and 
relatively stable, ensuring the table remains easy to manage and queries 
against it are performant. - Flexibility: The lookup table structure makes it 
easy to add more descriptive fields, refine advice, or even add new reliability 
categories in the future if needed, without requiring schema changes to other 
dependent tables like `food_water_sources_details`. - Audit Fields & Lifecycle: 
Full audit columns and the `is_active` flag provide a robust mechanism for 
tracking changes and managing the lifecycle of these reliability 
classifications. 12\. Next-Action Checklist - 🔴 Verify Prerequisite Tables: 
Confirm `public.profiles` and `public.translations` tables are V2 compliant and 
exist. - 🔴 Implement `water_reliability_types_master` Table: Execute the DDL 
for Version 1.2.1 as specified, ensuring RLS policies use the correct role 
names (e.g., `platform_admin`). - 🔴 Apply Triggers: Ensure the 
`set_current_timestamp_updated_at` trigger (using a standard helper function) 
and the `trigger_cleanup_water_reliability_type_translations` are created and 
correctly applied to the table. - 🔴 Initial Population / Seed Data: Insert the 
defined reliability types using the provided seed data examples. For each seed 
record, ensure `is_active` is set to `true` and `created_by_profile_id` is 
populated with a designated system administrator's profile ID. - 🟠 RLS Helper 
Functions: Ensure that helper functions like 
`public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'role_name')` are defined, secure, and 
used consistently in RLS policies. - 🟠 RLS Policies: Implement and thoroughly 
test the RLS policies defined for this table. - 🟢 Icon Design and 
Coordination: Develop or source appropriate icons for each `icon_identifier` 
defined in the seed data and coordinate these with the UI/UX team for 
consistent implementation and understanding. - 🟢 Translation Entries: Prepare 
initial English entries for all translatable fields (`label`, `description`) in 
the `public.translations` table, ensuring they are correctly linked by 
`table_identifier` ('water_reliability_types_master'), `column_identifier` 
('label' or 'description'), and `row_foreign_key` (the `id` of the master 
record).
