https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app/d423d51e9f40da78 ### 3\. Updated 
Production-Ready Specification (`food_water_sources_details`) This document 
details the structure, purpose, and considerations for the 
`food_water_sources_details` table, Version 1.3.1 (reflecting RLS role name 
alignment). This version incorporates full V2 enhancements including robust 
audit fields, refined i18n strategy, array foreign key integrity with active 
status checks, and media linking. It does *not* include denormalized English 
labels from master tables. 1\. Purpose & Primary Use-Cases The 
`food_water_sources_details` table stores specific attributes for waypoints 
that are food establishments (restaurants, cafes, grocery stores) or water 
sources (fountains, springs). It extends the generic `waypoints` entry to 
include crucial details such as the type of source, potability and reliability 
of water, price range for commercial establishments, types of meals served, 
dietary options, payment methods, and opening hours. This information is vital 
for pilgrims for logistical planning, ensuring they can find sustenance and 
safe drinking water along their route. Key user-story touchpoints: - Pilgrim: 
Finding places to eat or resupply groceries along the trail. - Pilgrim: 
Locating reliable sources of potable water. - Pilgrim: Filtering food options 
by type (restaurant, cafe), price range, or dietary accommodations (vegetarian, 
gluten-free). - Pilgrim: Checking opening hours for food establishments or 
availability notes for water sources. - Content Manager/Admin: Adding and 
maintaining detailed, accurate information about food and water points. 2\.

`waypoint_id` (`BIGINT`). - Foreign Keys: - `source_type_id` REFERENCES 
`public.food_water_source_types_master(id)` ON DELETE RESTRICT. (Integrity: 
Referenced master record must have `is_active = true`, enforced by 
`trigger_check_fwsrc_source_type_active`). - `water_reliability_id` REFERENCES 
`public.water_reliability_types_master(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL. (Integrity: 
Referenced master record must have `is_active = true`, enforced by 
`trigger_check_fwsrc_water_reliability_active`). - 
`establishment_price_range_id` REFERENCES 
`public.establishment_price_ranges_master(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL. (Integrity: 
Referenced master record must have `is_active = true`, enforced by 
`trigger_check_fwsrc_price_range_active`). - Audit FKs 
(`created_by_profile_id`, `updated_by_profile_id`) to `public.profiles(id)` ON 
DELETE SET NULL. - Array Foreign Keys: - `serves_meal_type_tag_ids` (elements 
`INTEGER`) to `meal_type_tags_master(id)`. - `dietary_option_tag_ids` (elements 
`INTEGER`) to `dietary_option_tags_master(id)`. - `payment_method_tag_ids` 
(elements `INTEGER`) to `payment_methods_master(id)`. - Integrity for all array 
FKs (ensuring each referenced ID exists in its master table and that the master 
record has `is_active = true`) is enforced by dedicated database triggers 
(`trigger_check_fwsrc_serves_meal_types`, 
`trigger_check_fwsrc_dietary_options`, `trigger_check_fwsrc_payment_methods`). 
- Linking Tables: `public.food_water_source_media` (Version 1.0) links this 
table to `public.media` for managing galleries or specific media roles 
associated with a food/water source. Its own DDL includes audit columns, 
`updated_at` trigger, and orphan translation cleanup for its translatable 
fields. 6\. Multilingual Strategy - Directly Translatable Fields (Primary 
reference language: English, translated via `public.translations`): - 
`water_source_access_notes` - Elements within 
`highlighted_dishes_local_specialties` (each string in the array is 
individually translatable) - `opening_hours_text_notes` - 
`specific_notes_for_pilgrims` - `food_water_source_media.caption_override` (for 
linked media) - `food_water_source_media.alt_text_override` (for linked media) 
- Indirectly Translatable Fields (via `label` fields in referenced master 
tables, which are fetched by views or application logic): - `source_type_id` 
(links to `food_water_source_types_master.label`) - `water_reliability_id` 
(links to `water_reliability_types_master.label`) - 
`establishment_price_range_id` (links to 
`establishment_price_ranges_master.label`) - `serves_meal_type_tag_ids` 
(elements link to `meal_type_tags_master.label`) - `dietary_option_tag_ids` 
(elements link to `dietary_option_tags_master.label`) - 
`payment_method_tag_ids` (elements link to `payment_methods_master.label`) - 
Orphan Cleanup: The `trigger_cleanup_food_water_sources_details_translations` 
(`AFTER DELETE` on `food_water_sources_details`) removes related entries from 
`public.translations` for this table and its media linking table 
(`food_water_source_media`). Referenced master tables are responsible for their 
own translation cleanup via their respective triggers. 7\. Role-Based Workflow 
& RLS Notes - Key Fields for Workflow: `data_last_verified_at` and 
`opening_hours_last_verified_at` are crucial for content managers to track and 
indicate the freshness of the information. Audit columns provide traceability 
of changes. The overall visibility is controlled by the parent `waypoints` 
record's status. - RLS Policies: - Row-Level Security is enabled on 
`food_water_sources_details` and its media linking table. - Public Users 
(`SELECT`): Can read details of food/water sources associated with waypoints 
that are published (via `waypoints.content_visibility_status_id` joining to 
`content_statuses_master.is_publicly_visible = TRUE`) and not soft-deleted 
(`waypoints.deleted_at IS NULL`). - Privileged Users (e.g., `platform_admin`, 
`regional_content_manager` roles, identified via `public.has_role_on_profile` 
helper): Have `ALL` permissions (CRUD). - `WITH CHECK` conditions prevent 
non-`platform_admin` users from re-parenting `waypoint_id` on `UPDATE`. - RLS 
policies for all prerequisite master tables ensure public read access only to 
`is_active = true` records, while `platform_admin` users have full control. 8\. 
ENUM vs Lookup Discussion - All relevant former ENUM concepts for this table's 
context (`food_water_source_type_enum`, `water_reliability_enum`, price range 
ENUM, meal types ENUM, dietary options ENUM, payment methods ENUM) have been 
successfully promoted to full V2-compliant master lookup tables 
(`food_water_source_types_master` (V1.2.1), `water_reliability_types_master` 
(V1.2.1), `establishment_price_ranges_master` (V1.1), `meal_type_tags_master` 
(V1.1), `dietary_option_tags_master` (V1.1), `payment_methods_master` (V1.1)). 
This is a robust and flexible approach, providing better data integrity, 
translatability, lifecycle management (`is_active`), auditability, and the 
ability to add descriptive attributes like icons. 9\. UI/UX Enablement - 
Filtering and Identification: All `*_id` and `*_tag_ids` fields, by linking to 
master tables that store `icon_identifier` and translatable `label` fields, 
will power UI filters and provide clear visual cues (icons, names) for users to 
identify and select different types of food sources, water reliability, price 
ranges, meal types, dietary options, and payment methods. - Critical 
Information Display: `is_potable_water_source` is a key boolean flag that must 
be prominently and clearly displayed for water sources. 
`opening_hours_structured` can be parsed to show "Open Now?" indicators or 
detailed daily schedules. - Rich Details: Fields like 
`highlighted_dishes_local_specialties`, `water_source_access_notes`, and 
`specific_notes_for_pilgrims` provide valuable, context-specific information 
directly displayable on detail pages. - Media: The `food_water_source_media` 
table allows for a gallery, enhancing visual appeal and information. 10\. Key 
Considerations & Definitions - UI Adaptation Based on `source_type_id`: The 
user interface should dynamically adapt based on the 
`food_water_source_types_master.is_commercial` flag associated with the linked 
`source_type_id`. For example, fields like `establishment_price_range_id`, 
`serves_meal_type_tag_ids`, and `payment_method_tag_ids` are typically relevant 
only for commercial types and might be hidden or disabled for non-commercial 
sources like public fountains. - Clarity on `is_potable_water_source`: This 
field is `NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`. The UI must clearly differentiate for the 
user between sources explicitly marked as "potable" (`TRUE`), those explicitly 
"not potable" (`FALSE` unless other indicators like a "non-potable" 
`source_type_id` apply), and potentially "unknown/unverified" status (which 
might be inferred if `source_type_id` is a water type but 
`is_potable_water_source` is `FALSE` and `water_reliability_id` indicates 
unknown reliability). Data entry workflows must enforce explicit confirmation 
for setting this to `TRUE`. - Array FK Validation: The database triggers for 
`serves_meal_type_tag_ids`, `dietary_option_tag_ids`, and 
`payment_method_tag_ids` are critical for ensuring data integrity and that only 
active master records are referenced. - `opening_hours_structured` (JSONB): 
Adherence to the centrally defined JSON schema for this field is critical for 
consistent data entry by content managers and reliable parsing by the 
application for display. - Data Verification: Workflows for content managers to 
regularly update `opening_hours_last_verified_at` and `data_last_verified_at` 
are important for maintaining user trust in the accuracy of the information. 
11\. Scalability & Future-Proofing - The use of structured data via linked 
master tables for classifications and `JSONB` for flexible data like opening 
hours provides excellent scalability and makes the system adaptable to future 
enhancements without requiring significant schema alterations to this detail 
table. - Comprehensive audit columns and `is_active` flags on master tables 
support robust data governance and lifecycle management. - The 1:1 relationship 
with `waypoints` means that any partitioning strategy implemented for 
`waypoints` would naturally apply to `food_water_sources_details` as well. 12\.
