# 1.7 Recommended Image Processing Pipeline Overview

Processing Pipeline (High-Level) 
------------------------------------------------------------- This outlines a 
conceptual pipeline for processing uploaded images and generating the variants 
defined in the manifest. This would typically be implemented as a backend 
service or a series of serverless functions (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions). 
Trigger: - An image is successfully uploaded to Supabase Storage. - A new 
record is created in the `public.media` table with basic metadata (original 
path, uploader, mime type, etc.). `media_status` might be 
`'processing_upload'`. Pipeline Steps: 1. Queue & Intake: - The new `media` 
record (or a message with its ID and original storage path) is added to a 
processing queue (e.g., Supabase Functions, RabbitMQ, SQS) to decouple 
processing from the upload request. 2. Validation & Initial Metadata Extraction 
(Worker Process): - Retrieve original image from Supabase Storage. - Validate 
file type and integrity. Check against any platform limits (max dimensions, 
file size). - Extract metadata: - Original dimensions 
(`image_width_px_original`, `image_height_px_original`). - (Optional) Dominant 
color (`dominant_color_hex`). - (Optional) SHA256 checksum 
(`checksum_sha256_original`) if not done at upload. - Update the corresponding 
`public.media` record with this extracted metadata. 3. Variant Generation: - 
For each relevant definition in the "Image Variant Manifest": - Resize/Crop: 
Apply transformations (e.g., resize to width, scale to fit, center-crop) based 
on manifest rules for the current variant. - Reformat: Convert to target 
format(s) (e.g., WebP, optimized JPG/PNG). - Optimize: Apply compression. 
Adjust quality settings to balance file size and visual fidelity. - Naming: Use 
a consistent naming convention for variant files (e.g., 
`media_uuid/variant_key.webp`). 4. Store Variants: - Upload each generated 
variant to a designated "variants" path in Supabase Storage (e.g., 
`gs://[bucket_name]/variants/[original_media_id]/[variant_key].webp`). 5. 
Update `public.media` Record: - Populate the `image_variants_json` field in the 
`public.media` record. The JSON should store key-value pairs where the key is 
the "Variant Key" from the manifest (e.g., `hero_lg_16x9_webp`) and the value 
is the storage path or a retrievable identifier for that variant. - Example 
`image_variants_json`: JSON ``` { "hero_lg_16x9_webp": 
"variants/your-media-uuid/hero_lg_16x9.webp", "hero_md_16x9_webp": 
"variants/your-media-uuid/hero_md_16x9.webp", "card_std_4x3_jpg": 
"variants/your-media-uuid/card_std_4x3.jpg" } ``` - Update `media_status` in 
`public.media` to `'pending_review'` or `'published_approved'` depending on 
workflow. 6. Cleanup & Error Handling: - Log all successes and failures. - 
Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors. - If processing fails 
critically, update `media_status` to `'error_uploading'` and notify 
administrators. - (Optional) Delete original from temporary processing location 
if applicable. Tools & Technologies (Suggestions): - Image Processing 
Libraries: - Node.js: Sharp (highly performant, uses libvips) - Python: Pillow, 
Wand (ImageMagick bindings) - Server-side: ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick - 
Backend/Functions: - Supabase Edge Functions (for lighter tasks or 
orchestrating external services). - Dedicated backend service (e.g., Node.js, 
Python, Go) for more intensive processing. - Queueing: If handling high volume, 
a message queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, AWS SQS) can manage 
processing tasks. Supabase's built-in function invocation might be sufficient 
for moderate loads. This pipeline ensures that original images are processed 
into a standardized set of optimized variants, ready for performant delivery to 
frontend applications, which can then request the appropriate variant based on 
UI context and device.
