# 1.6.1 Image Variant Manifest

  https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app/431cc17871bb821b Placeholder Image Variant 
Manifest (V1 Draft) -------------------------------------------------------- 
### 1\. Introduction This manifest outlines a recommended set of image variants 
to be generated by the platform's image processing pipeline. The goal is to 
provide optimized image sizes and formats for various UI contexts, ensuring 
fast load times and good visual quality, especially on mobile devices. Each 
variant definition should guide the backend image processing service. The 
`public.media.image_variants_json` field will store references (e.g., paths or 
keys) to these generated variants for each original uploaded image. ### 2\. 
Variant Naming Convention A consistent naming convention is crucial. 
Suggestion: `context_sizeDescriptor_aspectRatio_format` - Context/Usecase: 
e.g., `hero`, `gallery`, `card`, `thumb` - Size Descriptor: e.g., `lg` (large), 
`md` (medium), `sm` (small), or specific width like `w1920`, `w800`, `w400` - 
Aspect Ratio (Optional but recommended for key uses): e.g., `16x9`, `4x3`, 
`1x1` (square) - Format: e.g., `webp`, `jpg` Example: `hero_lg_16x9_webp`, 
`card_sm_4x3_jpg`, `thumb_sq_100_webp` ### 3\. Common Variant Definitions | 
Variant Key (Example) | Intended Use / Typical Role Association | Target 
Dimensions (Approx. WxH) | Aspect Ratio | Format(s) | Cropping Strategy | Notes 
| | `hero_lg_16x9` | Main hero images (Trails, Articles, Waypoints) for large 
desktop screens | `1920x1080px` | `16:9` | `WebP`, `JPG` | Center-Crop / 
Smart-Crop | Primary high-quality display. | | `hero_md_16x9` | Hero images for 
tablet / smaller desktop | `1280x720px` | `16:9` | `WebP`, `JPG` | Center-Crop 
/ Smart-Crop | | | `hero_sm_16x9` | Hero images for mobile screens | 
`768x432px` | `16:9` | `WebP`, `JPG` | Center-Crop / Smart-Crop | | | 
`gallery_display_lg` | Full-size gallery images (lightbox) | `max-width: 
1920px` | Original | `WebP`, `JPG` | Scale to Fit | Preserve original aspect 
ratio. | | `gallery_display_md` | Medium gallery images | `max-width: 1280px` | 
Original | `WebP`, `JPG` | Scale to Fit | | | `gallery_thumb_sq` | Square 
thumbnails for gallery previews | `400x400px` | `1:1` | `WebP`, `JPG` | 
Center-Crop | | | `card_std_4x3` | Standard image for listing cards (Trails, 
Articles, Waypoints) | `600x450px` | `4:3` | `WebP`, `JPG` | Center-Crop | 
Common for consistent card layouts. | | `avatar_lg_1x1` | User profile avatars 
(large display) | `200x200px` | `1:1` | `WebP`, `PNG` | Center-Crop | 
`public.profiles.public_avatar_media_id` | | `avatar_sm_1x1` | User profile 
avatars (small display, e.g., in comments) | `48x48px` | `1:1` | `WebP`, `PNG` 
| Center-Crop | | | `map_image_static_lg` | Detailed static map images | 
`max-width: 1200px` | Original | `PNG`, `JPG` | Scale to Fit | For clarity, PNG 
might be preferred if line art. | | `inline_image_md` | Images embedded within 
article body content | `max-width: 800px` | Original | `WebP`, `JPG` | Scale to 
Fit | Max width to fit content column. | Notes on Manifest: - This is a 
starting point. Actual dimensions and variants will depend on final UI design. 
- The image processing pipeline should aim to generate WebP for modern browsers 
and fall back to JPG/PNG for others, or provide both. - Consider file size 
targets for each variant to optimize performance. * * * * *
