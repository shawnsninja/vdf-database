# 3.0.3 View v_regions_list_localized

  https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app/a3fdff8118a11194 Okay, let's create the 
specification for the view public.v_regions_list_localized . Specification: 
public.v_regions_list_localized (View) 1. Purpose & Primary Use-Cases Purpose : 
To provide a simplified and denormalized representation of essential region 
information required for list displays, with textual fields already translated 
into available languages. Each row in the view represents a region in a 
specific language. Primary Use-Cases : Populating lists of regions in a user's 
selected language on websites and mobile applications (e.g., for Browse 
available pilgrimage areas). Simplifying queries for a potential GET /regions 
API endpoint by pre-joining regions with translations for names, descriptions, 
and primary media details. Providing a basis for filtering regions by various 
criteria while displaying localized names. 2. View Definition (SQL DDL) SQL

shown, add: -- AND (m.id IS NULL OR m.media_status = 'approved'); -- This is 
reflected in the media_is_approved flag instead for filtering flexibility by 
the consumer. COMMENT ON VIEW public.v_regions_list_localized IS 'Provides a 
denormalized and localized list of regions for display purposes, joining 
regions with their translations for name, description, and primary media 
details in various languages. Each row represents a region in one specific 
language. Version 1.0' ; 3. Output Columns Column Name Data Type Description 
region_id INTEGER The unique ID of the region (from public.regions.id ). 
region_slug TEXT The URL-friendly slug of the region (from public.regions.slug 
). is_featured BOOLEAN Flag indicating if the region is featured. 
region_content_visibility_status content_visibility_status_enum Visibility 
status of the base region record. region_deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ Soft deletion 
timestamp for the base region record. map_default_latitude DOUBLE PRECISION 
Default latitude for map centering. map_default_longitude DOUBLE PRECISION 
Default longitude for map centering. map_default_zoom SMALLINT Default zoom 
level for maps. language_code TEXT The language code (e.g., 'en', 'it') for the 
translated textual fields in this row. region_name TEXT The translated name of 
the region in the specified language_code . region_description TEXT The 
translated general description of the region in the specified language_code . 
primary_media_id INTEGER The ID of the region's primary media image. 
primary_image_thumbnail_url TEXT URL for a small thumbnail of the region's 
primary image (e.g., from image_variants_json ->> 'thumbnail_S' ). 
primary_image_alt_text TEXT The translated alt text for the region's primary 
image in the specified language_code . media_is_approved BOOLEAN Indicates if 
the linked primary media item is approved (based on media.media_status ). 4. 
Example Usage To get a list of featured regions in English, ordered by name: 
SQL SELECT region_id, region_slug, region_name, region_description, 
primary_image_thumbnail_url FROM public.v_regions_list_localized WHERE 
language_code = 'en' AND is_featured = TRUE -- AND (media_is_approved = TRUE OR 
primary_media_id IS NULL) -- If strict media approval is needed at query time 
ORDER BY region_name ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0 ; 5. Underlying Tables & Key Joins 
Primary Table : public.regions (aliased as r ) Key Joins : public.translations 
(multiple times for region_name , region_description , media_alt_text ). Joins 
are based on table_identifier , row_foreign_key , column_identifier , 
language_code , and translation_status = 'published_live' . public.media (as m 
): For primary image details. 6. RLS (Row-Level Security) Considerations The 
view will be defined with SECURITY INVOKER by default. RLS policies on 
public.regions , public.media , and public.translations will apply based on the 
querying user's permissions. The view's base WHERE clause ( r.deleted_at IS 
NULL AND r.content_visibility_status = 'published' ) filters for publicly 
visible regions. Consumers of the view might also want to filter on 
media_is_approved = TRUE if display of unapproved media is undesirable. 7. 
Performance & Optimization Notes Indexing : Crucial indexes on 
public.translations : A composite index on (table_identifier, 
column_identifier, language_code, row_foreign_key, translation_status) or 
similar is vital. Ensure r.primary_media_id in public.regions is indexed (as 
it's an FK, this is often automatic but good to verify). Indexes on 
public.regions.is_featured , public.regions.content_visibility_status , and 
public.regions.deleted_at will aid filtering. Join Strategy : The INNER JOIN 
for region_name_trans ensures regions must have a published name in at least 
one language to appear. Other translated fields use LEFT JOIN . Materialized 
View : If read performance for common languages is critical, this view could be 
materialized and refreshed periodically. Filtering : Always include WHERE 
language_code = 'desired_lang' when querying. 8. Assumptions & Dependencies 
Assumes public.translations.translation_status column exists and 
'published_live' is the correct value for visible translations. The 
column_identifier for the main region description is assumed to be 
'description' . Assumes public.media.media_status column exists and 'approved' 
is the correct value for visible media. Assumes specific keys like 
'thumbnail_S' exist in public.media.image_variants_json . Assumes 
table_identifier for media translations is 'media' and column_identifier is 
'alt_text' . 9. Next-Action Checklist 🟠 Finalize translation_status and 
media_status values : Confirm the exact values to use for 'published' or 
'approved' statuses in translations and media tables. 🟠 Confirm 
image_variants_json keys : Verify the specific key for thumbnails (e.g., 
thumbnail_S ) in media.image_variants_json . 🟠 Confirm column_identifier for 
Region Description : Ensure 'description' is the correct column_identifier for 
the desired descriptive text in translations for regions, or adjust if a 
specific 'short_description' field is used for lists. 🟠 Test View Definition : 
Create and thoroughly test the view with sample data, covering various 
languages and scenarios (missing descriptions, missing media, unapproved 
media). 🟢 Create Indexes : Ensure optimal indexes exist on public.translations 
and public.regions supporting the view's joins and filters. 🟢 Integrate into 
API : Update any GET /regions (list) API endpoint logic to query this view. 🟢 
Monitor Performance : After deployment, monitor the performance and consider 
materialization if needed. 🟢 Document for API Consumers : Clearly document the 
view's output columns and effective querying patterns.
