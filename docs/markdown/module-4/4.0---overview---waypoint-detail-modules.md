4. Waypoint Detail Modules (Version 1.2) 
--------------------------------------------------------- Last Updated: May 18, 
2025 (Reflecting finalized V1.2/V1.3 master table and waypoints specifications, 
auth architecture, localized views, and API translation model) ### 1\. 
Executive Summary This "Waypoint Detail Modules" (Module 4) provides the core 
system for managing Points of Interest (POIs) or "waypoints" for the Via di 
Francesco Pilgrimage Platform. It enables centralized storage of geographical 
data, detailed descriptions (translatable), categorization, tagging, and 
content lifecycle management. This module is fundamental for interactive map 
displays, route construction, POI discovery, and presenting curated content. 
This version reflects the finalization of core table specifications: 
`waypoint_categories_master` (v1.2), `tags_master` (v1.3), 
`content_statuses_master` (v1.2), and the main `waypoints` table (v1.3). These 
updates align with V2 database patterns, including standardized audit trails, 
`is_active` flags for master data lifecycle, `deleted_at` for soft-deleting 
waypoints, and robust internationalization (i18n) support. Internationalization 
is primarily handled via the central `public.translations` table, with API 
responses providing directly translated text fields based on a `lang` query 
parameter. Localized views like `public.v_waypoint_categories_localized` and 
`public.v_tags_localized` are specified to support efficient retrieval of 
translated master data. The platform-wide security and authentication 
architecture, using Supabase Auth and standardized RLS helper functions (e.g., 
`public.has_role(TEXT)`), is integrated into the RLS policies for all tables in 
this module. While the core `waypoints` table and its master data are now 
well-defined for V1, its 1:1 detail extension tables (e.g., for accommodations, 
attractions) are pending full V2 review and specification. ### 2\. Group-Level

centers around the `waypoints` table and its supporting master data 
definitions: - `waypoints` Table (Version 1.3 Finalized): - The central 
repository for all distinct, geographically located points. - Key attributes 
include a `BIGINT id`, `name` (primary English, translatable via 
`public.translations`), `slug` (unique, kebab-case), 
`alternate_names_primary_lang` (for English synonyms), `description` (primary 
English, translatable), and an authoritative `geom` (PostGIS PointZ geography, 
SRID 4326). - Generated columns `latitude`, `longitude`, and `elevation_meters` 
are derived from `geom`. - Boolean flags facilitate filtering (e.g., 
`is_seasonal`, `is_franciscan_highlight_site`). - Foreign keys link to 
`waypoint_categories_master` (via `waypoint_primary_category_id`), 
`tags_master` (via an integer array `waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids`), `towns` 
(via `town_id`), `media` (for `primary_image_media_id` and 
`primary_thumbnail_media_id`), `content_statuses_master` (via 
`content_visibility_status_id`), and `profiles` (for `created_by_profile_id`, 
`updated_by_profile_id` audit trails). - Supports hierarchical waypoints via 
`parent_waypoint_id`. - A critical database trigger, 
`trigger_check_waypoint_subcategory_tags`, must enforce the integrity of 
`waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids` against `tags_master.id`, ensuring referenced 
tags exist and are active (`tags_master.is_active = true`). - An `updated_at` 
trigger automatically manages the modification timestamp. The 
`content_visibility_status_id` defaults to a 'draft' status (via direct default 
value in DDL referencing `content_statuses_master.id` for code 'draft'). Soft 
deletion is handled by the `deleted_at` timestamp column. - 
`waypoint_categories_master` Table (Version 1.2 Finalized): - Defines broad 
classifications for waypoints (e.g., "Accommodation Location," "Attraction"), 
replacing a simpler ENUM structure for richer categorization. - Key columns: 
`id` (SERIAL PK), `code` (unique, snake_case), `label` (primary English, 
translatable via `public.translations`), `description` (primary English, 
translatable, nullable), `icon_identifier`, `requires_detail_table`, 
`sort_order`, and `is_active` (boolean for lifecycle management). - Includes 
full standard audit columns: `created_at`, `updated_at`, 
`created_by_profile_id`, `updated_by_profile_id`. - Linked from 
`waypoints.waypoint_primary_category_id`. - `tags_master` Table (Version 1.3 
Finalized): - Stores a curated list of descriptive tags for granular 
classification (e.g., "Franciscan Site," "Pilgrim Menu Available") and 
potentially for other entities like events. This replaces free-text arrays for 
primary managed tags, enhancing standardization and searchability. - Key 
columns: `id` (SERIAL PK), `tag_code` (unique, snake_case), `label` (primary 
English, translatable via `public.translations`), `description` (primary 
English, translatable, nullable), `tag_type` (for grouping tags, e.g., 
'amenity'), `icon_identifier`, `sort_order`, and `is_active` (boolean for 
lifecycle). - Referenced by `waypoints.waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids` (an 
`INTEGER[]` column). Integrity is enforced by a database trigger on the 
`waypoints` table. - Includes full standard audit columns. - 
`content_statuses_master` Table (Version 1.2 Finalized): - Defines the various 
states in a content lifecycle (e.g., "Draft," "Published," "Archived"), 
replacing a simpler ENUM. - Key columns: `id` (SERIAL PK), `code` (unique, 
snake_case), `label` (primary English, translatable via `public.translations`), 
`description` (primary English, translatable, nullable), `is_publicly_visible` 
(boolean indicating if content *assigned* this status is generally visible to 
the public), `sort_order`, and `is_active` (boolean for the lifecycle of the 
status definition itself). - Linked from 
`waypoints.content_visibility_status_id`. - Includes full standard audit 
columns. - Localized Views (Version 1.1 Specified): - 
`public.v_waypoint_categories_localized`: Provides waypoint categories with 
their base English fields and an `all_translations` JSONB column containing all 
available translations for labels and descriptions, keyed by language code. - 
`public.v_tags_localized`: Similarly provides tags with their base English 
fields and an `all_translations` JSONB column. - These views are designed to 
simplify API development by pre-joining master table data with their 
corresponding translations from `public.translations`, supporting efficient 
localized data retrieval for API endpoints. ### 4\. Cross-Cutting Concerns - 
Users & Roles: - Ownership and modification tracking utilize 
`created_by_profile_id` and `updated_by_profile_id` (UUIDs referencing 
`public.profiles(id)`) in `waypoints` and all master tables within this module. 
- RLS policies leverage `auth.uid()` and the standardized helper function 
`public.has_role(TEXT)`, which checks the current user's roles stored in 
`public.profiles.roles TEXT[]`. - Content moderation workflow is driven by 
`waypoints.content_visibility_status_id` linking to `content_statuses_master`. 
- Translations / i18n: - The central `public.translations` table (v2.1 spec) 
stores all translated text. - Fields in `waypoints` (e.g., `name`, 
`description`, `address_text`, `short_narrative_for_dynamic_lists`, 
`waypoint_accessibility_notes`) are defined in the database as primary 
reference language (English) and are translatable via this system. The 
`alternate_names_primary_lang` field in `waypoints` specifically stores English 
synonyms. - Master tables (`waypoint_categories_master`, `tags_master`, 
`content_statuses_master`) have `label` and `description` fields stored in 
English, also translatable via `public.translations`. - API responses will 
provide text fields (e.g., `name`, `label`) directly translated based on the 
`lang` query parameter, falling back to English if the specific translation is 
unavailable. - The localized views (`v_waypoint_categories_localized`, 
`v_tags_localized`) provide an `all_translations` JSONB column, which the API 
layer can use to extract the requested language or to populate translated 
fields. - `AFTER DELETE` triggers on all translatable tables (e.g., 
`waypoint_categories_master`, `tags_master`, `content_statuses_master`, and 
`waypoints` if its direct text fields are deleted) must call a standardized 
function like `public.cleanup_related_translations` to prevent orphaned entries 
in `public.translations`. - ENUM & Taxonomy Registry: - 
`waypoint_categories_master` was promoted from an ENUM to a table. - 
`tags_master` was promoted from a free-text array concept for structured, 
managed tags. The `waypoints.general_tags_text` TEXT[] column is retained for 
ad-hoc, non-managed textual tags. - `content_statuses_master` was promoted from 
an ENUM to a table. - Media & Files: - `waypoints.primary_image_media_id` and 
`waypoints.primary_thumbnail_media_id` (UUIDs) link to the central 
`public.media(id)` table. - For galleries or multiple distinct media roles 
associated with waypoints (beyond primary/thumbnail), the V2 strategy suggests 
new `[entity_name]_media` many-to-many linking tables (e.g., `waypoint_media`) 
which would include a `media_role_code` FK to a new `public.media_roles_master` 
table. This is a broader platform enhancement. - Audit / Soft-Delete / 
Versioning: - Standard Audit Columns: All tables in this module (`waypoints`, 
`waypoint_categories_master`, `tags_master`, `content_statuses_master`) include 
`created_at`, `updated_at` (with an auto-update trigger), 
`created_by_profile_id`, and `updated_by_profile_id`. - Soft-Delete: The 
`waypoints` table uses a `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` column for soft 
deletion. Master tables (`waypoint_categories_master`, `tags_master`, 
`content_statuses_master`) use an `is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true` 
flag to manage their lifecycle. - Versioning: Basic versioning is tracked via 
`updated_at`. Full content versioning is a post-V2 consideration. ### 5\. 
Security & Access Control 🔐 - RLS Overview: - Row-Level Security (RLS) is 
enabled on all tables in this module. - Policies are defined based on user 
roles (obtained via `public.has_role(TEXT)` checking `public.profiles.roles`) 
and data ownership (e.g., `created_by_profile_id = auth.uid()`). - Public Users 
(Anonymous & Authenticated without specific edit roles): Generally have 
read-only access to `is_active = true` master data and `waypoints` where 
`content_visibility_status_id` corresponds to a publicly visible status (e.g., 
'published' from `content_statuses_master` where `is_publicly_visible = true`) 
and `deleted_at IS NULL`. - Authenticated Users with Specific Roles: - 
`accommodation_host`: May have write access to their specific 
accommodation-linked waypoints (details TBD with accommodation module). - 
`regional_content_manager`: Can create/update/delete waypoints and related 
content within their assigned geographical regions (requires helper like 
`user_manages_region(auth.uid(), waypoints.region_id)`). - `admin`: Broader 
content management capabilities, potentially across regions. - 
`platform_admin`: Typically manages master data definitions (categories, tags, 
statuses) and has wider system access. - Policy Examples for Master Tables: - 
`waypoint_categories_master`: - Public: `SELECT` `USING (is_active = true)`. - 
Platform Admin: `ALL` `USING (public.has_role('platform_admin')) WITH CHECK 
(public.has_role('platform_admin'))`. - `tags_master`: - Public: `SELECT` 
`USING (is_active = true)`. - Platform Admin/Admin: `ALL` `USING 
(public.has_role('platform_admin') OR public.has_role('admin')) WITH CHECK 
(...)`. - `content_statuses_master`: - Public: `SELECT` `USING (is_active = 
true)` (to read status *definitions*). - Platform Admin: `ALL` `USING 
(public.has_role('platform_admin')) WITH CHECK (...)`. - `waypoints` Table RLS 
(Conceptual based on v1.3 spec): - Public Read: `SELECT` `USING 
(content_visibility_status_id IN (SELECT id FROM content_statuses_master WHERE 
code = 'published') AND deleted_at IS NULL)`. - Content Creators/Managers 
Write: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` `USING ( (created_by_profile_id = 
auth.uid() AND public.has_role('authenticated_user')) OR 
public.has_role('regional_content_manager') /* + region check */ OR 
public.has_role('admin') ) WITH CHECK (...)` (simplified example). - SECURITY 
DEFINER Functions: Helper functions like `public.has_role(TEXT)` are typically 
`SECURITY INVOKER` (default). Functions performing actions that require 
bypassing the calling user's RLS (rare, use with extreme caution) would be 
`SECURITY DEFINER` and need careful `search_path` management. The translation 
cleanup triggers also run as `SECURITY DEFINER`. ### 6\. Prerequisite Objects & 
Build Order ⚙️ 1. Global Functions & ENUMs/Types (Ensure these exist from 
project-level setup): - `public.set_current_timestamp_updated_at()` (or 
`extensions.moddatetime`). - `public.cleanup_related_translations(TEXT 
table_name_param)` (adapted to use `OLD.id::TEXT` internally for the specific 
row key). - `public.has_role(TEXT) RETURNS BOOLEAN`. - Other specific RLS 
helper functions (e.g., `user_manages_region`). - PostGIS extension and types 
(e.g., `geography(PointZ, 4326)`). 2. Core Tables (Assumes `auth.users`, 
`public.profiles`, `public.media`, `public.towns`, `public.translations`, 
`public.languages_master` exist): - `public.waypoint_categories_master` (DDL 
v1.2). - `public.tags_master` (DDL v1.3). - `public.content_statuses_master` 
(DDL v1.2). - Crucial: Populate `content_statuses_master` with initial values 
(especially 'draft', 'published') *before* creating `waypoints` table, due to 
`waypoints.content_visibility_status_id` potentially having a default value 
that references an ID from this table. - `public.waypoints` (DDL v1.3). - *(1:1 
detail extension tables like `accommodations` are V2 scope for full spec)*. 3. 
Views: - `public.v_waypoint_categories_localized` (SQL definition from `4.0.2 - 
Views for Module 4.docx`). - `public.v_tags_localized` (SQL definition from 
`4.0.2 - Views for Module 4.docx`). 4. Indexes & Constraints (Beyond PK/FKs 
defined in table DDLs): - Apply all specified indexes from table specs (e.g., 
on `is_active`, `sort_order`, `code`, `label` for master tables; `geom`, 
`content_visibility_status_id`, `waypoint_primary_category_id`, 
`waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids`, `name`, `deleted_at` for `waypoints`). - Ensure 
`idx_translations_lookup` on `public.translations` is created. 5. Triggers: - 
`updated_at` triggers on all tables in this module. - 
`cleanup_related_translations` triggers on `waypoint_categories_master`, 
`tags_master`, `content_statuses_master`, and `waypoints` (for its direct 
translatable fields if any rows are hard deleted). - 
`trigger_check_waypoint_subcategory_tags` on `waypoints` (validates against 
`tags_master.id` and `tags_master.is_active`). 6. RLS Policies: Enable RLS and 
apply all defined policies to module tables. ### 7\. Performance & Optimization 
Extras - Key Indexes & Why: - Master tables: Indexes on `code` (for lookups), 
`is_active` (for filtering active records), `sort_order`, `label` (for default 
language sorting) are crucial. - `waypoints`: GIST index on `geom` (essential 
for spatial queries); GIN on `name` (for trigram search); GIN on 
`waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids` (for multi-tag filtering). - 
`public.translations`: The composite index `idx_translations_lookup 
(table_identifier, row_foreign_key, language_code, column_identifier)` is vital 
for the performance of localized views and any direct translation lookups. - 
Partitioning Strategies: Not planned for V1 for this module. `waypoints` could 
be a candidate in the future if it grows extremely large and queries 
demonstrate performance issues related to table scans. - 
Caching/Materialized-View Refresh Cadence: - The specified localized views 
(`v_waypoint_categories_localized`, `v_tags_localized`) are standard SQL views. 
If their performance (due to joins with a very large `translations` table) 
becomes a bottleneck, they could be converted to materialized views with an 
appropriate refresh strategy (e.g., triggered on changes to base tables or on a 
schedule). - Application-level caching for frequently accessed, relatively 
static master data (categories, tags, statuses) is recommended. ### 8\. Visuals

Setup (Platform Admin Role): - `platform_admin` defines entries in 
`waypoint_categories_master`, `tags_master`, `content_statuses_master` using 
their respective API POST endpoints or a dedicated admin interface. English 
text is provided for `label` and `description` fields during creation. 
`is_active` is typically set to `true`. - Translations for these master data 
`label` and `description` fields are subsequently added to the 
`public.translations` table for various languages (e.g., Italian, German). 2. 
Waypoint Creation (Content Manager/Admin Role): - User (e.g., 
`regional_content_manager`) submits data for a new waypoint via `POST 
/waypoints` API endpoint. `name`, `description`, and other translatable text 
fields are provided in English (the primary reference language). - The 
`waypoints` record is INSERTED. `waypoint_primary_category_id` is selected from 
active categories, `geom` is provided. `waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids` are 
selected from active tags. - `content_visibility_status_id` DEFAULTS to the ID 
for 'draft' status from `content_statuses_master`. Audit fields (`created_at`, 
`created_by_profile_id`, etc.) are set automatically. - The database trigger 
`trigger_check_waypoint_subcategory_tags` validates that all IDs in 
`waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids` exist in `tags_master` and that those tags have 
`is_active = true`. - Further translations for the new waypoint's `name`, 
`description`, etc., can be added to `public.translations`. 3. Moderation & 
Publication Workflow: - A Content Manager or Admin updates the 
`waypoints.content_visibility_status_id` (e.g., to 'pending_review', then to 
'published') via `PATCH /waypoints/{waypoint_id}` endpoint. - The 
`is_publicly_visible` flag in the `content_statuses_master` record for the 
'published' status (code 'published') is `TRUE`. 4. End-User Consumption 
(Pilgrim via API with `lang` parameter): - The client application queries API 
endpoints (e.g., `GET /waypoints?lang=it`, `GET /waypoint_categories?lang=it`). 
- The API backend: - For master data (categories, tags): Uses the localized 
views (e.g., `v_waypoint_categories_localized`) which join with 
`public.translations`. It extracts the Italian text for fields like `label` and 
`description` from the `all_translations` JSONB object or uses the primary 
English field if Italian is unavailable. - For waypoint data: Directly joins 
`waypoints` with `public.translations` (or uses a similar dynamic 
view/function) to retrieve the Italian `name`, `description`, etc., based on 
the `lang=it` parameter. If no Italian translation exists, it falls back to the 
English text stored in the `waypoints` table's `name`/`description` columns. - 
RLS Policy Enforcement: - Public users see `is_active=true` master data. - For 
`waypoints`, RLS restricts visibility to records where 
`content_visibility_status_id` corresponds to a 'published' status (i.e., one 
where `content_statuses_master.is_publicly_visible = true`) AND 
`waypoints.deleted_at IS NULL`. - Data is displayed to the pilgrim with 
`label`, `name`, `description` fields containing Italian text. ### 10\. 
Critical Gaps & Risks - 🔴 Array FK Integrity Trigger Implementation: The 
`check_waypoint_subcategory_tags` function and trigger for 
`waypoints.waypoint_subcategory_tag_ids` (validating against `tags_master.id` 
and `tags_master.is_active`) is mandatory and needs to be precisely implemented 
and tested to ensure data integrity. Similar triggers are needed for *any* 
other array FKs in waypoint detail tables that reference master lists (e.g., 
`events_details.event_theme_or_focus_tag_ids`). - 🔴 RLS Helper Functions & 
Policies: Robust implementation, security review (especially for `SECURITY 
DEFINER` functions if any are strictly needed beyond translation cleanup), and 
thorough testing of `public.has_role(TEXT)` and any region/ownership management 
helpers are critical for the entire security model. RLS policies for 
`waypoints` need to be fully defined and tested. - 🟠 API Layer Translation 
Logic: The API backend requires logic to correctly interpret the `lang` 
parameter, query the appropriate views or join with `translations` table, 
handle fallbacks to the primary language (English), and structure the response 
so that fields like `name` or `label` directly contain the translated text. - 
🟠 Waypoint Detail Extension Tables V2 Review: Full V2 specification and review 
for the 1:1 detail tables linked from `waypoints` (e.g., `accommodations`, 
`attractions_details`, `food_water_sources_details`, etc.) are still pending 
and are essential for the complete functionality of Module 4. This includes 
their schemas, i18n, RLS, audit, media linking, and any array FK integrity 
checks they might require. - 🟠 Initial Data Population Strategy: A clear 
process for setting `created_by_profile_id` in master tables during initial 
seed data loading (e.g., using a designated system administrator `profile_id`) 
is required. ### 11\. Scalability & Future-Proof Notes - ID Types: `BIGINT` for 
`waypoints.id` supports a large number of waypoints. UUIDs for `media` and 
`profiles` are standard. - Lookup Tables: Promotion of ENUMs to master tables 
with `is_active` flags, audit trails, and translatable fields provides 
excellent flexibility and maintainability. - Localized Views & Translations: 
Using views with JSONB for all translations (as in 
`v_waypoint_categories_localized.all_translations`) offers a flexible backend 
mechanism. The API then presenting directly translated fields simplifies client 
consumption. - Soft Deletes & Audit Columns: Support data retention, history, 
and accountability across the module. - Geospatial Data: PostGIS `geography` 
type is appropriate for global data. Generated coordinate columns can aid 
non-PostGIS clients but do store redundant data. ### 12\. Next Steps - P0 🔴 
Finalize & Implement `waypoints` Detail Extension Table Specs: Prioritize the 
full V2 review, specification, and DDL/RLS implementation for tables like 
`accommodations`, `attractions_details`, etc.. - P1 🔴 Implement & Test Array 
FK Integrity Triggers: - Deploy and thoroughly test 
`check_waypoint_subcategory_tags` for `waypoints` table. - Identify and 
implement similar triggers for all other tables using array FKs to master lists 
(e.g., in the detail extension tables). - P1 🔴 Implement & Test RLS Policies: 
Finalize and test RLS policies for `waypoints` and its detail extension tables, 
ensuring correct use of `public.has_role(TEXT)` and other helper functions. - 
P1 🟠 Develop API Backend Translation Logic: Implement the API layer logic to 
handle the `lang` parameter, query views/translations table, and provide 
responses with directly translated text fields. - P2 🟠 Populate Master Tables 
& Translations: Load initial seed data for `waypoint_categories_master`, 
`tags_master`, `content_statuses_master`, and their corresponding English (and 
other initial target language) translations into `public.translations`. - P2 🟠 
Refine API Endpoints for Waypoint Detail Types: Develop specific API endpoints 
for managing the 1:1 waypoint detail extensions (e.g., `GET 
/waypoints/{id}/accommodations`, `POST /waypoints/{id}/accommodations`) once 
their DB specs are finalized.
