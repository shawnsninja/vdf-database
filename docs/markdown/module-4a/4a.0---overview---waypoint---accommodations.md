https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app/3332d7c5163a3dae 4.a -- Overview -- Waypoint 
Accommodations Module (Version 1.0) 
============================================================= This document 
provides a comprehensive overview of the "4.a Waypoint -- Accommodations" 
database module, detailing its structure, functionality, security, API 
interactions, and deployment considerations within the Via di Francesco 
Pilgrimage Platform. It reflects the finalized V1 specifications for its 
constituent tables and views. ### 1\. Executive Summary This database module is 
dedicated to managing all accommodation-specific information, forming a 
critical component of the "Waypoint Detail Modules" (Module 4). It enables 
pilgrims to discover, filter, and understand lodging options through detailed 
attributes such as type, availability, amenities, room configurations, payment 
methods, meal services, and user-submitted reviews. For hosts and platform 
administrators, it provides the necessary tools for managing listings and 
related content. The module features a normalized structure with a central 
`accommodations` table, numerous specialized master tables for consistent data 
categorization (e.g., `accommodation_types_master`, `amenities_master`), and 
junction tables to handle many-to-many relationships (e.g., 
`accommodation_amenities`). It also includes `accommodation_reviews` for 
user-generated feedback. Multilingual support is a core feature, with 
translatable fields in most tables managed via a central `public.translations` 
table and accessed efficiently through dedicated localized views (e.g., 
`v_accommodation_types_localized`). Security is enforced through robust 
Row-Level Security (RLS) policies aligned with the platform's authentication 
architecture. This module underpins key API endpoints for listing and detailing 
accommodations. ### 2\. Group-Level Snapshot | Group | Key Tables & Views |

`establishment_price_ranges_master`, `meal_type_tags_master`, and 
`dietary_option_tags_master` are included in this module's documentation set as 
per the provided specifications, their primary linkage and utility are with 
other waypoint detail modules such as "Food & Water Sources". They provide 
general master data for categorization.* ### 3\. Narrative Walkthrough This 
section details the core tables and views comprising the 4.a Waypoint -- 
Accommodations module. - `accommodations` (Version 1.5): The central table for 
detailed lodging information, extending a generic `waypoints` record. It stores 
contact details, booking information, operational specifics (check-in/out 
times), pricing notes, pilgrim-focused services, and seasonal availability 
(`opening_months` validated by `public.are_valid_months` function). Key foreign 
keys link to `waypoints` (itself the PK `waypoint_id`), 
`accommodation_types_master`, `booking_statuses_master`, and `profiles` (for 
`host_profile_id` and audit fields `created_by_profile_id`, 
`updated_by_profile_id`). Many text fields are translatable (e.g., 
`host_name_or_organization`, `booking_notes`). - Master Data Tables (Lookup 
Tables): These provide standardized, translatable categories and attributes. 
Each typically includes `id` (PK), a unique `code`, `label` (English), 
`description` (English, optional), `icon_identifier` (optional), `sort_order`, 
`is_active` flag, and full audit columns. Their translatable fields (`label`, 
`description`, `category`) are accessed via localized views. - 
`accommodation_types_master` (Version 1.4): Defines accommodation types (e.g., 
"Pilgrim Hostel", "B&amp;B"). - `booking_statuses_master` (Version 1.4): Lists 
booking availability statuses (e.g., "Open - Bookings Available") and includes 
an `is_positive_status` flag. - `amenities_master` (Version 1.5): Details 
amenities offered (e.g., "Wi-Fi Internet", "Guest Kitchen Access"), including a 
translatable `amenity_category` and `is_common_pilgrim_need` flag. - 
`room_types_master` (Version 1.5): Classifies room types (e.g., "Private Double 
Room") with characteristics like `typical_capacity_persons` and 
`is_dorm_style`. - `payment_methods_master` (Version 1.4): Lists accepted 
payment methods (e.g., "Cash (EUR)", "Visa"), with a translatable `category`. - 
`meal_services_master` (Version 1.5): Defines meal services an accommodation 
might offer (e.g., "Breakfast Available"). - 
`establishment_price_ranges_master` (Version 1.4): Categorizes price levels for 
commercial establishments (e.g., "Budget Friendly (€)") including a `symbol`. 
Primarily serves other modules. - `meal_type_tags_master` (Version 1.4): 
Standardizes tags for meal types at food establishments (e.g., "Breakfast", 
"Lunch"). Primarily serves other modules. - `dietary_option_tags_master` 
(Version 1.4): Lists dietary options catered to by food establishments (e.g., 
"Vegetarian Friendly"). Primarily serves other modules. - Junction Tables: 
These establish many-to-many relationships between `accommodations` and master 
tables, often storing context-specific, translatable notes. They include 
surrogate PKs (`id`), audit columns, and `ON DELETE CASCADE` from 
`accommodations` and `ON DELETE RESTRICT` to the master table. A `UNIQUE` 
constraint typically exists on `(accommodation_waypoint_id, 
<master_table>_id)`. - `accommodation_amenities` (Version 1.4): Links 
`accommodations` to `amenities_master`; stores `notes_on_amenity` 
(translatable). - `accommodation_room_configurations` (Version 1.5): Links 
`accommodations` to `room_types_master`; stores `count_of_this_room_type`, 
pricing details, `price_notes` (translatable), and `room_specific_notes` 
(translatable). - `accommodation_payment_methods` (Version 1.4): Links 
`accommodations` to `payment_methods_master`; stores `notes_on_method` 
(translatable). - `accommodation_meal_services` (Version 1.4): Links 
`accommodations` to `meal_services_master`; stores pricing details and 
`availability_and_timing_notes` (translatable). - User Interaction Table: - 
`accommodation_reviews` (Version 1.0): Stores user-submitted reviews, including 
`review_title` (translatable), `review_body` (translatable), `language_code`, 
`stay_date`, `overall_vote` (`vote_type_enum`), and `moderation_status` 
(`content_moderation_status_enum`). Features an auto-calculated 
`is_publicly_visible` flag and a `deleted_at` for soft deletes. - Localized 
Views (Version 1.0 each): For each master table listed above (e.g., 
`v_accommodation_types_localized`, `v_amenities_localized`, 
`v_payment_methods_localized`, etc.), a corresponding view exists. These views 
provide all columns from their base master table and an additional 
`all_translations` JSONB column. This JSONB object aggregates all available 
translations for fields like `label`, `description`, and `category` (where 
applicable), keyed by language code, simplifying multilingual data retrieval 
for APIs. - Summary View: - `accommodations_capacity_summary_view`: Calculates 
`calculated_total_beds` and `calculated_total_rooms` per accommodation by 
joining `accommodations`, `accommodation_room_configurations`, and 
`room_types_master`. - Triggers: Standard `updated_at` triggers (via 
`public.set_current_timestamp_updated_at()`) are applied to all tables. 
Junction tables often have conditional `updated_at` triggers. All tables with 
translatable fields have `AFTER DELETE` triggers to execute specific 
`cleanup_<tablename>_translations()` functions, which remove orphaned entries 
from `public.translations`. ### 4\. Cross-Cutting Concerns - Users & Roles: - 
User identity via `public.profiles(id)` is central for ownership 
(`accommodations.host_profile_id` ) and auditing (`created_by_profile_id`, 
`updated_by_profile_id` in most tables ). - Application-specific roles (e.g., 
'pilgrim', 'host', 'moderator', 'admin_platform') are stored in 
`public.profiles.roles` (TEXT ARRAY) and are key to RLS policy enforcement, 
often checked using helper functions like 
`public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'role_code')`. - 
`accommodation_reviews` has a dedicated moderation workflow using 
`moderation_status` and `is_publicly_visible` fields. - Translations / i18n: - 
A central `public.translations` table stores all translated text. Primary 
reference language (English) content is stored directly in the base table 
columns (e.g., `accommodations.host_name_or_organization`, 
`amenities_master.name`). - Translatable fields include names, descriptions, 
notes, and categories across `accommodations`, master tables, junction tables, 
and `accommodation_reviews`. - The `row_foreign_key` in `public.translations` 
uses the respective PK of the translated record (e.g., 
`accommodation_types_master.id`, `accommodation_amenities.id`). - `AFTER 
DELETE` triggers ensure orphaned translations are removed. - Localized views 
(e.g., `v_accommodation_types_localized` ) provide an `all_translations` JSONB 
object for master data, simplifying API responses for multilingual content. API 
`lang` parameter determines the language for directly resolved fields. - ENUM & 
Taxonomy Registry: - Several former ENUM types were promoted to the master 
tables detailed in this module (e.g., `accommodation_types_master` replaces 
`accommodation_type_enum`) for richer data, i18n, and lifecycle management. - 
`accommodation_reviews` depends on globally defined `public.vote_type_enum` and 
`public.content_moderation_status_enum`. - Media & Files: - This module does 
not directly manage binary file storage. Primary images for accommodations are 
handled by the parent `waypoints` table's linkage to `public.media`. - 
`icon_identifier` fields in master tables (e.g., 
`amenities_master.icon_identifier` ) store text references for UI icons, 
managed externally. - Audit / Soft-Delete / Versioning: - Audit: All tables 
include `created_at` and `updated_at` (auto-updated). Most also track 
`created_by_profile_id` and `updated_by_profile_id`. - Soft-Delete: 
`accommodation_reviews` uses `deleted_at`. For `accommodations`, this is 
handled via the parent `waypoints.deleted_at` field. Master tables utilize an 
`is_active` boolean flag for lifecycle management. - Versioning: Basic 
versioning via `updated_at`. Row-level content versioning is not implemented. 
Specification documents are versioned. ### 5\. Security & Access Control 🔐 - 
Authentication Provider: Supabase Auth is the chosen provider, utilizing JWTs. 
- Application Roles: Granular roles (e.g., 'pilgrim', 'host', 'moderator', 
'admin_platform') are stored in `public.profiles.roles` and synchronized to JWT 
custom claims (e.g., `app_roles`) or queried by RLS helper functions. - RLS 
Overview: Row-Level Security is enabled on all relevant tables. Policies are 
designed to: - Allow public (`anon`, `authenticated` roles) read-only access to 
published/active accommodation data and approved reviews. - Enable 'pilgrim' 
role users to create and manage (update/soft-delete) their own 
`accommodation_reviews`, subject to moderation status. - Permit 'host' role 
users to perform CRUD operations on their own `accommodations` records (where 
`accommodations.host_profile_id = auth.uid()`) and associated junction table 
entries (e.g., `accommodation_amenities`, `accommodation_room_configurations`). 
- Grant 'moderator', 'regional_content_manager', and 'admin_platform' roles 
progressively broader management capabilities over accommodation data and 
reviews. 'admin_platform' typically has full CRUD on master data definitions. - 
RLS Helper Functions: Policies extensively use 
`public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'role_code')` (or a similar JWT claim 
checking function `current_user_has_app_role(TEXT)` ) and `auth.uid()` for 
dynamic permission checks. - `WITH CHECK` Clauses: Employed in RLS policies for 
`INSERT` and `UPDATE` to enforce data integrity, ownership, prevent reparenting 
of records, and ensure linked master data is `active`. - Security Headers & 
Cookies: Standard Supabase practices, including `apikey` and `Authorization: 
Bearer <JWT>` headers for API requests. - Error Handling & Rate Limiting: 
Conforms to the platform-wide strategy: standard HTTP status codes, a 
consistent JSON error object structure (`code`, `message`, `details`, `hint`), 
and role-based rate limiting. ### 6\. API Endpoints Summary 🚀 The API for 
Module 4a - Accommodations primarily supports pilgrim-facing queries and 
host/admin management of lodging information. It leverages localized views for 
efficient multilingual data retrieval. - `GET /accommodations`: Lists 
accommodations with pagination and extensive filtering (e.g., 
`near_waypoint_id`, `town_id`, `accommodation_type_codes`, `amenity_codes`, 
`min_beds`, `opening_month`). Accepts `lang` for localization. Public access. - 
`GET /accommodations/{waypoint_id}`: Retrieves comprehensive details for a 
single accommodation. Includes linked amenities, room configurations, payment 
methods, meal services, and recent reviews, all with translated content where 
applicable. Accepts `lang` and `reviews_limit`. Public access. *A dedicated 
PostgreSQL function (e.g., `get_public_accommodation_details`) is highly 
recommended for this endpoint's complex data aggregation*. - `POST /reviews`: 
Authenticated pilgrims submit new `accommodation_reviews`. - `PUT 
/reviews/{review_id}`: Authenticated pilgrims update their own (typically 
pending) `accommodation_reviews`. - `PATCH /admin/reviews/{review_id}/status`: 
Administrators/moderators update the `moderation_status` of an 
`accommodation_review`. - Meta Endpoints (`GET /meta/...`): Publicly list 
active master data with all translations, leveraging localized views: - `GET 
/meta/accommodation-types` (uses `v_accommodation_types_localized`) - `GET 
/meta/booking-statuses` (uses `v_booking_statuses_localized`) - `GET 
/meta/amenities` (uses `v_amenities_localized`) - `GET /meta/room-types` (uses 
`v_room_types_localized`) - `GET /meta/payment-methods` (uses 
`v_payment_methods_localized`) - `GET /meta/meal-services` (uses 
`v_meal_services_localized`) - (Conceptual endpoints for 
`establishment-price-ranges`, `meal-type-tags`, `dietary-option-tags` would use 
their respective localized views). ### 7\. Prerequisite Objects & Build Order ⚙️ 
1. Global Helper Functions & ENUMs (Assumed: 
`public.set_current_timestamp_updated_at()`, `public.are_valid_months()`, 
translation cleanup wrappers, RLS helpers like `public.has_role_on_profile()`, 
`public.vote_type_enum`, `public.content_moderation_status_enum`). 2. Core 
Tables (Master Data First) (Assumed: `auth.users`, `public.profiles`, 
`public.languages_master`, `public.translations`, `public.waypoints`, 
`public.content_statuses_master`): - `public.accommodation_types_master` - 
`public.booking_statuses_master` - `public.amenities_master` - 
`public.room_types_master` - `public.payment_methods_master` - 
`public.meal_services_master` - `public.establishment_price_ranges_master` - 
`public.meal_type_tags_master` - `public.dietary_option_tags_master` 3. Main 
Entity Table: - `public.accommodations` 4. Junction Tables: - 
`public.accommodation_amenities` - `public.accommodation_room_configurations` - 
`public.accommodation_payment_methods` - `public.accommodation_meal_services` 
5. User Content Table: - `public.accommodation_reviews` 6. Views: - 
`public.accommodations_capacity_summary_view` - 
`public.v_accommodation_types_localized` - 
`public.v_booking_statuses_localized` - `public.v_amenities_localized` - 
`public.v_room_types_localized` - `public.v_payment_methods_localized` - 
`public.v_meal_services_localized` - 
`public.v_establishment_price_ranges_localized` - 
`public.v_meal_type_tags_localized` - `public.v_dietary_option_tags_localized` 
7. Indexes & Constraints: Apply all as defined in individual table DDLs. 8. 
Triggers: Apply all `updated_at` and translation cleanup triggers. 9. RLS 
Policies: Enable RLS and apply all policies for each table. ### 8\. Performance 
& Optimization Extras - Key Indexes: - PKs, FKs, and unique `code` columns on 
master tables are indexed. - Junction tables feature composite unique 
constraints (e.g., `(accommodation_waypoint_id, amenity_id)`) which are 
indexed, along with indexes on individual FKs. - 
`accommodations.host_profile_id` indexed for efficient host-specific queries. - 
`accommodations.opening_months` GIN index is crucial for filtering by 
`opening_month`. - `public.translations` requires a robust composite index 
(e.g., on `(table_identifier, row_foreign_key, language_code, 
column_identifier)`) for the performance of all localized views. - Localized 
Views (`v_*_localized`): These standard views are vital for simplifying API 
logic and providing translated master data efficiently. Their performance 
hinges on the `public.translations` indexing. For very high-read scenarios on 
slowly changing master data, materializing these views could be a V2+ 
optimization. - `accommodations_capacity_summary_view`: This standard view 
calculates capacity on-the-fly. If frequent calculations impact performance, it 
could be materialized, with a refresh strategy (e.g., nightly, or triggered on 
changes to `accommodation_room_configurations` or 
`room_types_master.typical_capacity_persons`). - Database Function for `GET 
/accommodations/{waypoint_id}`: A PostgreSQL function (e.g., 
`get_public_accommodation_details(p_waypoint_id BIGINT, p_lang TEXT) RETURNS 
JSONB`) is highly recommended to encapsulate the complex data aggregation and 
translation logic for the accommodation detail endpoint. This centralizes 
optimization efforts and simplifies the API application layer. ### 9\. Visuals

(Platform Admin): - Admin populates all `*_master` tables (e.g., 
`accommodation_types_master`, `amenities_master`) with codes, English 
labels/descriptions, icons, sort order, and sets `is_active=true`. Audit 
columns are populated. - Corresponding translations are added to 
`public.translations`. 2. Waypoint & Accommodation Shell Creation 
(Admin/Manager): - A `waypoints` record is created with the appropriate 
`waypoint_primary_category_id` indicating "accommodation". - An 
`accommodations` record is created, linking to the `waypoint_id`. 
`host_profile_id` can be assigned now or later. 3. Detailed Data Population 
(Host or Admin/Manager): - The assigned host (via 
`accommodations.host_profile_id`) or an Admin/Manager populates 
`accommodations` fields (contact info, booking notes, opening months, etc.). - 
Amenities are linked via `accommodation_amenities`, with optional 
context-specific notes. - Room configurations (type, count, price, notes) are 
defined in `accommodation_room_configurations`. This populates the 
`accommodations_capacity_summary_view`. - Accepted payment methods are linked 
via `accommodation_payment_methods`. - Offered meal services (with prices, 
timing notes) are linked via `accommodation_meal_services`. - All changes 
update relevant `updated_at` and `updated_by_profile_id` fields via triggers. 
4. Content Moderation & Publication (Admin/Manager): - Content is reviewed for 
accuracy. `accommodations.data_last_verified_at` may be updated. - The parent 
`waypoints.content_visibility_status_id` is set to 'published' to make the 
accommodation publicly visible. 5. Review Submission (Pilgrim): - An 
authenticated pilgrim with the 'pilgrim' role submits a review via the 
`accommodation_reviews` table. - `profile_id` is set to `auth.uid()`, and 
`moderation_status` defaults to 'pending_approval'. 6. Review Moderation 
(Moderator/Admin): - A user with 'moderator' or 'admin_platform' role reviews 
pending submissions in `accommodation_reviews`. - They update 
`moderation_status`, `moderated_by_profile_id`, `moderation_timestamp`, and 
optionally `moderation_notes_internal`. The `is_publicly_visible` flag updates 
automatically. 7. Pilgrim Data Consumption (Public/Authenticated Users): - 
Users access accommodation listings and details via API endpoints (e.g., `GET 
/accommodations`, `GET /accommodations/{waypoint_id}`). - RLS policies ensure 
users only see published, non-deleted accommodations and approved reviews. - 
The API uses localized views and the `public.translations` table, driven by the 
`lang` parameter, to serve content in the user's preferred language. 8. Ongoing 
Host Updates: - Hosts update dynamic information like 
`accommodations.booking_availability_status_id`, room prices in 
`accommodation_room_configurations`, or meal service notes in 
`accommodation_meal_services`. - 
`accommodations.booking_status_last_updated_by_host` is updated by the 
application. ### 11\. Critical Gaps & Risks - 🔴 ENUM Definitions: The global 
`public.vote_type_enum` and `public.content_moderation_status_enum` must be 
defined and accessible for `accommodation_reviews` to function correctly. - 🟠 
RLS Helper Function Implementation: The security model relies heavily on the 
correct and secure implementation of RLS helper functions like 
`public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'role_code')` or an equivalent JWT 
claim checker. - 🟠 Array FK Integrity for some Master Tables: While this 
module primarily uses junction tables, master tables like 
`meal_type_tags_master` and `dietary_option_tags_master` (if referenced by ID 
arrays in *other* modules like Food/Water Sources) require careful management 
or triggers to ensure integrity of array elements against `active` master 
records. - 🟠 Translation Workflow: A robust operational workflow for 
populating and managing translations in `public.translations` is crucial for 
the i18n strategy and is external to the DDLs. - 🟠 Initial Audit Field 
Population: Seed scripts for master data must correctly populate 
`created_by_profile_id` and `updated_by_profile_id` (e.g., with a designated 
system admin UUID). - 🟢 Database Functions: Existence of 
`public.set_current_timestamp_updated_at()` and 
`public.are_valid_months(INTEGER[])` is assumed and critical. ### 12\. 
Scalability & Future-Proof Notes - Lookup Tables (Master Data): The use of 
dedicated master tables for categorizations is highly scalable and allows for 
easy additions or modifications without schema changes to core entity tables. - 
Junction Tables: Standard M-M patterns with surrogate PKs (UUID or BIGINT) are 
scalable and simplify linking to other tables, including `translations`. - 
Currency: `price_currency_code` (default 'EUR') provides a hook for future 
multi-currency support, although V1 is specified as EUR-only. - Audit Trails & 
Lifecycle: Comprehensive audit columns and `is_active`/`deleted_at` flags 
ensure robust data history and lifecycle management. - Localized Views: Enhance 
API performance and simplify logic for multilingual content retrieval. 
Materialization is a future scalability option. - `accommodation_reviews`: This 
table is expected to grow. Effective indexing is essential, and partitioning 
could be considered for very high volumes in future versions. - Parent Table 
Timestamp Updates: For V2+, consider if CUD operations on junction tables 
(e.g., `accommodation_amenities`, `accommodation_meal_services`) should trigger 
an `updated_at` change on the parent `accommodations` record for cache 
invalidation or synchronization strategies. ### 13\. Next Steps - P0 🔴 
Implement/Verify Global Dependencies: - Ensure shared SQL functions and ENUM 
types are defined and correctly implemented. - Implement and rigorously test 
all RLS helper functions. - P1 🔴 Deploy Module Tables & Views: - Create all 
master tables, then `accommodations`, junction tables, and 
`accommodation_reviews` as per DDLs. - Create all specified localized views and 
`accommodations_capacity_summary_view`. - Apply all triggers and indexes. - P1 
🟠 Implement RLS Policies: Apply and thoroughly test RLS policies for all
