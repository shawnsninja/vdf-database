# 4.33 - reviews

  https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app/21b8e85b3e611787 New Table: 
public.accommodation_reviews (Version 1.0) (Module 6: User Interaction; closely 
related to Module 4a: Accommodations) 1. Purpose & Primary Use-Cases The 
public.accommodation_reviews table stores user-submitted reviews specifically 
for accommodations. It allows pilgrims to share their experiences, including 
textual feedback, an optional overall vote, and the date of their stay. The 
table supports multilingual content, moderation workflows, and audit trails. 
Key user-story touchpoints: Pilgrim (Anna): Reading reviews for an 
accommodation to help make lodging choices. Pilgrim (Anna): Submitting a review 
of an accommodation where they stayed. Accommodation Host (Marco): 
(Potentially, V2+) Viewing reviews for their establishment. Platform 
Administrator/Moderator (Sofia): Reviewing and approving/rejecting submitted 
reviews. System/UI: Displaying approved reviews on accommodation detail pages.

Primary Key: id (BIGINT). Foreign Keys: accommodation_waypoint_id REFERENCES 
public.accommodations(waypoint_id) ON DELETE CASCADE. profile_id REFERENCES 
public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE (if a user's profile is deleted, their 
reviews are also deleted). language_code REFERENCES 
public.languages_master(language_code) ON DELETE RESTRICT. 
moderated_by_profile_id REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL. 
updated_by_profile_id REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE SET NULL. 
Generated Column: is_publicly_visible depends on moderation_status and 
deleted_at . ENUMs: Relies on public.vote_type_enum and 
public.content_moderation_status_enum (assumed to be defined globally or in 
Module 6). 6. Multilingual Strategy review_title and review_body are 
translatable. The original language is stored in language_code . Translations 
are managed in the public.translations table. table_identifier : 
'accommodation_reviews' column_identifier : 'review_title' or 'review_body' 
row_foreign_key : The id (BIGINT) of the accommodation_reviews record. An AFTER 
DELETE trigger ( trigger_cleanup_accommodation_reviews_translations ) is 
implemented. 7. Role-Based Workflow & RLS Notes Public Users 
(Anonymous/Authenticated without specific roles): Can SELECT reviews where 
is_publicly_visible = true . Authenticated Users (Pilgrim Role): Can INSERT new 
reviews (defaulting to moderation_status = 'pending_approval' , profile_id = 
auth.uid() ). Can UPDATE their own reviews if moderation_status is 
'pending_approval' OR if an edit window is allowed post-approval (requires 
careful WITH CHECK and potentially versioning/re-moderation logic - for V1, 
keep simpler: edit only if pending). updated_by_profile_id would be auth.uid() 
. Can UPDATE their own reviews to set deleted_at (soft delete). 
updated_by_profile_id would be auth.uid() . Moderator/Admin Roles: Can SELECT 
all reviews, regardless of is_publicly_visible . Can UPDATE any review's 
moderation_status , moderated_by_profile_id , moderation_timestamp , 
moderation_notes_internal , deleted_at . updated_by_profile_id would be 
auth.uid() . Can DELETE records (hard delete, if necessary, though soft delete 
via deleted_at is preferred). RLS Policies Example Snippets: SQL -- Public Read 
CREATE POLICY "Public can read approved and visible reviews" ON 
public.accommodation_reviews FOR SELECT USING (is_publicly_visible = true ); -- 
Authenticated users can insert their own reviews CREATE POLICY "Authenticated 
users can insert their own reviews" ON public.accommodation_reviews FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (profile_id = auth.uid()); -- Users can update their own pending 
reviews or soft delete them CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own reviews 
if pending or soft delete" ON public.accommodation_reviews FOR UPDATE USING 
(profile_id = auth.uid()) WITH CHECK ( profile_id = auth.uid() AND ( 
(OLD.moderation_status = 'pending_approval' AND OLD.deleted_at IS NULL ) OR -- 
Can edit most fields if pending (NEW.deleted_at IS NOT NULL AND OLD.deleted_at 
IS NULL ) -- Can soft delete -- Add more complex logic here if edits after 
approval are allowed ) ); -- Moderators/Admins can manage all reviews CREATE 
POLICY "Moderators can manage all reviews" ON public.accommodation_reviews FOR 
ALL USING (public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'moderator' ) OR 
public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'admin_platform' )) -- Example role 
check WITH CHECK (public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'moderator' ) OR 
public.has_role_on_profile(auth.uid(), 'admin_platform' )); Enable RLS on the 
table after policies are defined. 8. ENUM vs Lookup Discussion Relies on 
vote_type_enum and content_moderation_status_enum . These are ENUMs as per 
existing patterns for similar concepts in the project. 9. UI/UX Enablement 
Display of reviews (title, body, author, stay date, overall vote) on 
accommodation pages. Form for submitting reviews. Moderation interface for 
admins/moderators. Potentially, filtering or sorting reviews by stay date or 
overall vote. 10. Key Considerations & Definitions ENUM Definitions : 
vote_type_enum (e.g., 'up', 'down', or perhaps a 1-5 star rating if changed 
from proposal) and content_moderation_status_enum (e.g., 'pending_approval', 
'approved_visible', 'rejected_hidden') must be created and managed. The 
proposal used 'pending_approval', 'approved_visible'. Edit Policy : The RLS 
example allows editing only for 'pending_approval' status. If reviews can be 
edited after approval, this needs careful consideration regarding re-moderation 
workflows. overall_vote Integration : For V1, this field is a simple attribute 
of the review. It does not automatically update aggregated votes on the 
waypoints table or link to user_waypoint_votes . Such integration is a V2+ 
consideration. Anonymity : The current design links directly to profile_id . If 
anonymous reviews (or reviews displayed with less identifiable user info) are 
needed, this requires further design. For V1, linking to profile_id is assumed. 
11. Scalability & Future-Proofing The table can grow large. Proper indexing is 
crucial. Partitioning by accommodation_waypoint_id or created_at (e.g., yearly) 
could be a V2+ consideration if volume becomes extremely high. Adding features 
like "Was this review helpful?" votes, or host replies, would be future 
extensions. 12. Next-Action Checklist 🔴 Define/Verify ENUM Types : Ensure 
public.vote_type_enum and public.content_moderation_status_enum are defined 
according to project standards. 🔴 Create Table : Execute the DDL for 
public.accommodation_reviews (Version 1.0). 🔴 Apply Triggers : Ensure 
set_current_timestamp_updated_at and 
trigger_cleanup_accommodation_reviews_translations are created and applied. 🔴 
Create Indexes : Implement all necessary indexes as defined in the DDL. 🟠 RLS 
Policies : Implement and thoroughly test the RLS policies, including helper 
functions like has_role_on_profile . 🟠 Review Edit Workflow : Confirm the 
business rules for when a user can edit their review and adjust RLS UPDATE 
policy if needed. 🟢 Translation Entries : Plan for how original review text 
will be flagged for translation if automated translation is a feature, or how 
user-submitted translations would be handled (V2+). For V1, language_code 
captures the submission language. 🟢 Moderation Interface : Plan the UI/UX for 
the review moderation workflow.
