# Importer & Database Alignment Handoff — 2025-09-22

## Current Focus
- Keep migrations for modules 1–9 fully rerunnable and ready for downstream API consumption (web, mobile, WordPress, guide exports).
- Document the promotion plan and module specs (`2025-05-17 - checklist.docx`) so the next agent can advance towards production-readiness and admin tooling.
- Convert the importer dry-run work into an auditable data-ingestion loop that can power GPX-based segment anchoring without risking live data during QA.

## What Was Completed (2025-09-22 cycle)
- **Module 7 localized views fixed** – `migrations/007-curated-itineraries/005_localized_views.sql` now pulls towns via `public.town_display_name(...)`, resolves accommodations through waypoint metadata + translations, and handles `current_setting('app.current_lang')` safely.
- **Modules 8–9 hardened** – media role schema unified on the `code` primary key, triggers/policies guarded with `DO` blocks + `public.ensure_policy`, and Module 9 update triggers made idempotent so reruns are clean.
- **Full clean migration chain verified** – `./scripts/run-migrations.sh` from a dropped schema now succeeds through Module 9. Latest proof log: `out/logs/migrations_2025-09-22T220201Z.log`.
- **Importer dry-run alignment** – `scripts/importer_v1.py` respects `--dry-run` (no writes, summary logged), producing QA output (`out/logs/importer_2025-09-22T221350Z_apply.log`). Archived handoff artifact: `out/qa/importer_2025-09-22T221500Z.md`.
- **Language & media contracts checked** – editorial views reference `public.profiles` public fields, media tables rely on canonical `storage_object_path_original`, ensuring consistency for future API serializers.
- **Importer apply mode prepared** – `scripts/importer_v1.py` now defaults to dry-run, adds an explicit `--apply` flag, resolves waypoint category IDs, and writes segments with schema-aligned columns.
- **API/admin draft captured** – Initial read-model and admin workflow outline documented in `docs/api-admin-requirements-2025-09-22.md` to guide downstream teams.


## Why This Matters for the Apps
- The schema now supports multi-channel consumers (gronse.com, mobile apps, WordPress) by exposing localized views that default to English but can pivot on `app.current_lang` and leverage `public.translations`.
- Trails, towns, segments, and accommodations share media-role vocabulary, making it straightforward to assemble PDF guide exports, on-trail sheets, or API responses without hard-coded role mismatches.
- Importer groundwork keeps GPX → segment alignment authoritative so future weather/conditions integrations can enrich the same lineage tables without manual re-entry.
- Translation tables stay the single source of truth for regional managers: admin tooling can permit Italian input while English (and other locale) fallbacks stay intact for the public audience.

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps
1. ✅ **Documentation finishing pass (2025-09-23)** – Module 7–9 `.docx` specs already cite importer apply evidence and QA artefacts (`7.0 - overview - Curated Itinerary Module.docx`, `8.0 overview.docx`, `9.0 overview.docx`). Re-run the checklist after any new importer runs or schema adjustments.
2. ✅ **Importer staging apply run (2025-09-24)** – Evidence captured in `out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T000842Z_dry.log`, `out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T002554Z_apply.log`, staging logs `out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T173617Z_*.log`, and QA notes `out/qa/importer_2025-09-24T002700Z.md`, `out/qa/importer_2025-09-24T173617Z_staging.md`. Repeat after schema or importer changes.
3. **Translation automation implementation** – Build the cron-friendly worker (`scripts/translation_automation/`), translation job queues, and reviewer tooling aligned with `migrations/001-user-content-infrastructure/014_translation_automation_wiring.sql`. Document deployment + QA in a new runbook, then update Module specs and this handoff.
4. **API & admin delivery** – Expand `docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml` into a consumable contract, define PostgREST/GraphQL deployment steps, and wire mutations/views that surface `translation_status_map`, importer metrics, and admin CRUD flows. Capture EXPLAIN baselines after each iteration.
5. **Operational hardening** – Publish a reset/migration playbook (Supabase reset vs. drop/create), add regression smoke tests for importer counts + view timings, and note monitoring expectations (ingestion runs, translation audits) in this handoff.
6. **Expanded GPX QA** – Run broader dry-run/apply tests to validate `segment_waypoints`, `segment_nearby_options`, variant groups, and Dutch-only flags; archive artefacts and summarize findings here.


## Coordination Notes
- Reset/migration runbook: see `docs/operations/reset-playbook.md` for local vs. staging workflows.
- Supabase local reset via `supabase db reset` seeds most schema objects; running `./scripts/run-migrations.sh` immediately after can hit duplicate-object errors. Either rely on one authoritative path or drop/reapply only the seed files still needed (see 2025-09-24 update).
- All migration runs assume the standard reset sequence:
  ```bash
  psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;"
  psql $DATABASE_URL -c "CREATE SCHEMA public;"
  psql $DATABASE_URL -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO postgres;"
  psql $DATABASE_URL -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO public;"
  ./scripts/run-migrations.sh > out/logs/migrations_<timestamp>.log
  ```
- Use `/Users/shawnsmith/.pyenv/shims/python3` for importer-related scripts; that interpreter has `psycopg` v3 installed.
- The importer dry-run currently short-circuits writes. For real imports remove the new guards or add a `--apply` flag so the behavior is explicit.
- Translations helper lives in `migrations/001-user-content-infrastructure/008_translations.sql`; do not call `public.town_display_name` before Module 1 completes.
- Media roles now rely on `public.media_roles_master.code`; ensure any seed scripts or Supabase functions use the new column names.

## Suggested Data Checks for Future QA
```sql
-- Confirm localized itinerary list returns expected columns
SELECT id, localized_title, start_town_name, suggested_accommodation_name
FROM public.view_curated_itinerary_segments
ORDER BY curated_itinerary_id, day_number, sort_order
LIMIT 20;

-- Validate editorial article output for multi-language apps
SET app.current_lang = 'it';
SELECT slug, localized_title, author_display_name, featured_image_path
FROM public.view_published_articles
ORDER BY publication_date DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 10;

-- Check importer linkage after a GPX load
SELECT segment_id, COUNT(*) AS waypoint_count
FROM public.segment_waypoints
GROUP BY segment_id
ORDER BY segment_id DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Hand-off Checklist for Next Agent
1. Module 7–9 `.docx` specs are current as of 2025-09-22 with importer apply evidence. Re-run the checklist after future importer runs or schema tweaks and update change logs accordingly.
2. Run importer on staging (dry-run then `--apply`) once credentials are available. Reference the latest local artefacts (`out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T000842Z_dry.log`, `out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T002554Z_apply.log`, `out/qa/importer_2025-09-24T002700Z.md`) for expected counts and QA queries.
3. Review `docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml` + `docs/api-admin-requirements-2025-09-22.md`, add EXPLAIN ANALYZE benchmarks for the key views, and expand GraphQL coverage as needed.
4. Document admin UX/RLS requirements, especially translation status controls and regional director permissions.
5. Implement translation automation wiring: add status columns/triggers, expose `translation_status_map` in API/GraphQL, and document reviewer playbook per the plan.
6. Record new findings or blockers back into this handoff file before closing the session.

### 2025-09-22T21:10Z Update
- Importer dry-run/apply attempts (`out/logs/importer_2025-09-22T211015Z_dry.log`, `out/logs/importer_2025-09-22T211038Z_apply.log`) failed before connecting because the staging `DATABASE_URL` password is still placeholder. No DB writes occurred. QA recap: `out/qa/importer_2025-09-22T211015Z.md`.
- Action needed: supply valid Supabase service-role credentials or start the local Supabase stack, then rerun importer to gather apply-readiness evidence for Modules 7–9.
- New API contract details (OpenAPI + GraphQL outline) captured in `docs/api-admin-requirements-2025-09-22.md`.
- Translation automation plan finalized for EN ➜ IT/ES/NL/DE/KO workflow: `docs/translation-automation-plan-2025-09-22.md`. Module specs and admin tooling should now reference the shared status taxonomy (`draft`, `machine_pending`, `in_review`, `published_live`, `archived`).
### 2025-09-22T22:15Z Update
- Local Supabase stack (`supabase start`) reset and migrations rerun successfully (`out/logs/migrations_2025-09-22T220201Z.log`).
- Importer dry-run and apply now succeed locally; see `out/logs/importer_2025-09-22T221420Z_dry.log`, `out/logs/importer_2025-09-22T221350Z_apply.log`, and QA summary `out/qa/importer_2025-09-22T221500Z.md` (segments=3, anchors=4, waypoints=1).
- `scripts/importer_v1.py` patched to add waypoint variant metadata and handle geometry/enum writes; schema updated via `migrations/009-segment-alignment/004_waypoint_variant_group.sql`.
- Ready to repeat the importer against additional payloads or promote the dataset to the hosted Supabase project once credentials are confirmed.

### 2025-09-23T21:45Z Update
- Reviewed Modules 7–9 specifications and confirmed checklist items now reference importer apply logs (`out/logs/importer_2025-09-22T221350Z_apply.log`, `out/qa/importer_2025-09-22T221500Z.md`).
- Noted that staging importer run remains blocked by missing credentials; local apply evidence is available for reference.
- Exported initial REST contract to `docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml`; remaining work is benchmarking key views and expanding GraphQL coverage alongside translation status surfacing.
- Added migration `migrations/001-user-content-infrastructure/014_translation_automation_wiring.sql` to introduce translation status enums/audits and surfaced `translation_status_map` in Modules 7–8 views.
### 2025-09-24T01:30Z Update
- Local Supabase stack reset via `supabase/migrations` baseline; resolved duplicate-object aborts by replaying only seed migrations (Module 4 categories & content statuses).
- Importer re-run locally (dry-run + apply) using the refreshed schema; see logs `out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T000842Z_dry.log`, `out/logs/importer_2025-09-24T002554Z_apply.log`, and QA note `out/qa/importer_2025-09-24T002700Z.md` (segments=3, anchors=4, waypoints=1, ingestion_run id=2).
- When repeating migrations, beware of duplication between `supabase/migrations` and repo `migrations/`; clean reset followed by targeted seeds avoids conflicts until the two paths are consolidated.

### 2025-09-24T11:56Z Update
- Local Supabase confirmed healthy after `supabase db reset` + `supabase start`; Postgres reachable (v17.4). Targeted top-off seeds applied:
  - `migrations/004-waypoint-details/002_waypoint_categories_master_seed.sql`
  - `migrations/004-waypoint-details/006_content_statuses_master_seed.sql`
- Importer re-run (dry-run then `--apply`) for stage `badia-prataglia` against `out/test_import_branch.json`:
  - Summary: segments=3, anchors=4, waypoints=1; ingestion_run id=1
  - QA note: `out/qa/importer_2025-09-24T004906Z.md`
  - Note: importer did not emit a non-empty log file this run; stdout summaries captured in QA note.
- Performance snapshots captured with a 10s statement timeout (no hangs observed):
  - `out/logs/explain_curated_itineraries_list_2025-09-24T115628Z.txt` → Planning 6.172 ms, Execution 0.335 ms
  - `out/logs/explain_curated_itinerary_detail_2025-09-24T115628Z.txt` → Planning 2.261 ms, Execution 0.198 ms
  - `out/logs/explain_curated_itinerary_segments_2025-09-24T115628Z.txt` → Planning 4.087 ms, Execution 0.151 ms
  - `out/logs/explain_published_articles_2025-09-24T115628Z.txt` → Planning 3.728 ms, Execution 0.153 ms
- Note on perceived stall: a prior `psql` run showed `Cancel request sent` (user interrupt) and `WalSenderWaitForWal` from Supabase’s local Logflare; both expected and not performance issues.

### 2025-09-24T17:36Z Staging Update
- Configured project-local REMOTE_DATABASE_URL in `.env.local` (pooler): `aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543` with username `postgres.<project_ref>`.
- Verified remote connectivity and applied required seeds on staging:
  - `migrations/004-waypoint-details/002_waypoint_categories_master_seed.sql`
  - `migrations/004-waypoint-details/006_content_statuses_master_seed.sql`
- Importer run (staging):
  - Dry-run and `--apply` succeeded for stage `badia-prataglia` (segments=3, anchors=4, waypoints=1); ingestion_run id=1
  - QA note: `out/qa/importer_2025-09-24T173617Z_staging.md`
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE (staging, 10s timeout guard):
  - `out/logs/explain_curated_itineraries_list_2025-09-24T173617Z_staging.txt` → Planning 43.973 ms, Execution 1.304 ms
  - `out/logs/explain_curated_itinerary_detail_2025-09-24T173617Z_staging.txt` → Planning 6.504 ms, Execution 0.243 ms
  - `out/logs/explain_curated_itinerary_segments_2025-09-24T173617Z_staging.txt` → Planning 8.558 ms, Execution 0.227 ms
  - `out/logs/explain_published_articles_2025-09-24T173617Z_staging.txt` → Planning 18.865 ms, Execution 0.888 ms
- Note: Direct host `db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432` did not resolve for this project; pooler endpoint works and is recommended.

### 2025-09-24T19:30Z Translation Automation Queue Update
- Applied migration `015_translation_jobs.sql` locally and on staging (pooler), plus a fix for `dequeue_translation_jobs` ambiguity:
  - `migrations/001-user-content-infrastructure/015_translation_jobs.sql`
  - `migrations/001-user-content-infrastructure/015_fix_dequeue_translation_jobs.sql`
- CLI smoke tests (local + staging):
  - Commands: `scan`, `stats`, `process --limit 5 --strategy skip`, `stats`
  - Local log: `out/logs/translation_automation_2025-09-24T191756Z_local.txt`
  - Staging log: `out/logs/translation_automation_2025-09-24T192712Z_staging.txt`
  - QA notes:
    - Local: `out/qa/translation_automation_2025-09-24T191756Z_local.md`
    - Staging: `out/qa/translation_automation_2025-09-24T192712Z_staging.md`
- Observations:
  - No eligible translations at this time → scans report 0 enqueued; stats show an empty queue; process reports “No pending jobs.”
  - Dequeue function updated to qualify column references and use quoted enum literals.

### 2025-09-24T20:45Z Roadmap Update
- Translation automation wiring (migration 014) plus job queue (migration 015) are ready for worker implementation; next step is to build the cron job + reviewer tooling and document the deployment in `docs/translation-automation-plan-2025-09-22.md`.
- API/OpenAPI draft (`docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml`) needs endpoint fleshing and GraphQL mutation coverage, then an implementation plan (PostgREST/Hasura or custom service) with RLS alignment.
- Operational runbook pending: publish a reset/migration guide and regression checklist (importer dry/apply, EXPLAIN snapshots, translation coverage) so future handoffs remain consistent.
