# Next Steps for VDF Database Implementation

## Current Status
âœ… **Module 1 Complete**: User & Content Infrastructure fully implemented with:
- All tables, functions, and triggers
- Complete RLS policies
- Audit infrastructure
- Test suite
- Migration runner script

## Recommended Implementation Order (Revised)

### Phase 1: Geographical Foundation
**Module 3 (Geographical Context) - Basic Tables First**
- Implement regions, provinces, and towns tables first
- These are referenced by trails in Module 2
- Prevents forward reference issues

### Phase 2: Trail System
**Module 2 (Core Trail Hierarchy)**
- Can now reference geographical entities
- Implement trails, routes, segments
- Trail media and terrain/usage types

### Phase 3: Complete Geography
**Module 3 (Geographical Context) - Remaining Features**
- Add service and characteristic tags
- Complete the geographical module

### Phase 4: Waypoints
**Module 4 (Waypoint Details)**
- Implement in sub-module order:
  - 4a: Accommodations
  - 4b: Attractions
  - 4c: Transportation
  - 4d: Events

### Phase 5: Dynamic Features
**Module 5 (Dynamic Conditions)**
- Trail warnings and conditions
- Real-time updates

### Phase 6: User Features
**Module 6 (User Interaction)**
- Voting system
- Tips and contributions

### Phase 7: Advanced Features
**Module 7 (Curated Itineraries)**
- Pre-planned routes
- Seasonal recommendations

**Module 8 (Editorial)**
- Articles and content management

## Immediate Next Action

1. **Run Module 1 Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vdf-database
   export DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
   ./scripts/run-migrations.sh 1
   ```

2. **Start Module 3 Basic Tables**:
   - Create `/migrations/003-geographical-context/`
   - Implement regions table first
   - Then provinces and towns
   - This provides the foundation for Module 2

## Architecture Considerations

1. **PostGIS Usage**: Now that we have PostGIS extension, use geometry columns for:
   - Region boundaries
   - Trail paths
   - Waypoint locations

2. **Performance**: Consider partitioning strategies for:
   - Translations table (by language_code)
   - Audit_log table (by created_at)
   - Media table (by created_at or media_status)

3. **Search Strategy**: With pg_trgm available, implement:
   - Fuzzy search on waypoint names
   - Trail name search
   - Town/region search

4. **Caching Strategy**: Plan for:
   - Materialized views for complex trail queries
   - Redis/Upstash for frequently accessed data
   - Edge caching for public endpoints

## Testing Strategy

For each module:
1. Create comprehensive test script like Module 1
2. Test all CRUD operations
3. Verify RLS policies
4. Check trigger functions
5. Validate foreign key relationships
6. Performance test with sample data

## Documentation Requirements

For each module maintain:
1. README with migration order
2. Test checklist
3. API usage examples
4. Common queries
5. Performance considerations
